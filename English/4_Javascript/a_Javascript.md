# JavaScript Can Change HTML Content

In JavaScript, one of the most common ways to interact with HTML is by using the `getElementById()` method. This method allows JavaScript to "find" an HTML element by its `id` and then change its content.

### Analogy
Imagine your HTML page is like a board with sticky notes (elements), each note has a unique label (an `id`). JavaScript is like a pair of hands that can reach out to one of those notes (by using `getElementById`), and rewrite the text on it (by modifying the `innerHTML`).

### Example
```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript";
```
In this example, JavaScript finds the sticky note labeled "demo" and replaces its content with "Hello JavaScript."

### Technical Explanation
- `innerHTML`: This property represents the content inside an HTML element. By assigning new content to `innerHTML`, you can change what's displayed on the page.

### Did You Know?
JavaScript allows you to use both single and double quotes when assigning text:
```javascript
document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 'Hello JavaScript';
```

---

## JavaScript Can Change HTML Attribute Values

JavaScript can also change the attributes of HTML elements, such as the source (`src`) of an image. Again, `getElementById()` is used to find the element, and then the specific attribute can be modified.

### Analogy
Think of an HTML element like a toy car, and the attributes are like the stickers or colors on the car. If you want to change how the car looks or behaves (like its color or which battery it uses), you modify these attributes.

### Example
```javascript
document.getElementById("myImage").src = "lightbulb-on.png";
```
Here, JavaScript is switching the `src` attribute of an image, changing which picture is displayed (in this case, turning a light bulb "on").

### Technical Explanation
- `src`: This is the attribute in an `<img>` tag that defines which image file should be displayed. By changing it, you can swap out the image on the page.

---

## JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS)

In addition to modifying HTML content and attributes, JavaScript can also change an element's style by manipulating CSS properties directly.

### Analogy
Imagine that HTML elements are like mannequins in a store window, and the CSS styles are the clothes they wear. JavaScript is like a stylist who can quickly change their outfit, for example, by making their font larger or changing the color of their shirt.

### Example
```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "35px";
```
In this case, JavaScript is changing the font size of the element with the `id` "demo" to 35 pixels.

### Technical Explanation
- `style`: This property allows you to access and modify the inline styles of an element. Any CSS rule, such as `fontSize`, `color`, or `margin`, can be changed dynamically through JavaScript.

---

## JavaScript Can Hide HTML Elements

You can use JavaScript to hide an element on the page by adjusting its `display` style.

### Analogy
Think of the HTML element as an object in a room. To hide it, it's like putting a blanket over the object‚Äîit‚Äôs still there, but no one can see it.

### Example
```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "none";
```
Here, JavaScript is setting the `display` property of the element "demo" to "none", effectively making it disappear from the page.

---

## JavaScript Can Show HTML Elements

Similarly, JavaScript can also make a hidden element reappear by changing the `display` property back to "block" or another visible value.

### Analogy
Using the same room analogy, showing an element is like pulling the blanket off the object, making it visible again.

### Example
```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "block";
```
With this code, the previously hidden "demo" element is made visible again.

---

## Did You Know?

JavaScript and Java might sound similar, but they are completely different languages in terms of design and concept.

- **JavaScript** was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 and became an official standard in 1997.
- **ECMA-262** is the formal name of the standard that defines JavaScript.
- **ECMAScript** is the official name of the language.

# Understanding the `<script>` Tag in HTML

## What is the `<script>` Tag?

Think of the `<script>` tag like a delivery van. It's how we get JavaScript, the language that brings your web pages to life, into your HTML. When we need to deliver functionality, like changing text or responding to a button click, we load JavaScript between `<script>` and `</script>` tags.

### Example:
```html
<script>
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
</script>
```
In this example, we use JavaScript to change the content inside an HTML element with the `id="demo"`. It‚Äôs like telling the delivery van to bring in new content.

---

## Old School vs. New School: `type="text/javascript"`

In the early days, you had to specify the type of script, like putting a label on a box so people knew what was inside. That‚Äôs why you might see this:

```html
<script type="text/javascript"></script>
```

But today, JavaScript is the default language. So just like with a familiar delivery service, we don‚Äôt need to label the box anymore. The browser already knows that `<script>` means JavaScript.

---

## JavaScript Functions and Events

A **function** in JavaScript is like a little machine inside our delivery van. When you push the button (or in code, when you "call" the function), it does something, like delivering a message.

An **event** is the button you push. It could be clicking a button, typing into a form, or scrolling a page.

### Example:

```html
<button onclick="myFunction()">Click me</button>
<script>
  function myFunction() {
    alert("Button was clicked!");
  }
</script>
```

Here, the function is the machine that shows an alert, and the event is the button click that starts the machine. Simple, right?

---

## Where Should You Put the `<script>`?

The `<script>` can go in different parts of your HTML: either in the `<head>` or in the `<body>`. It‚Äôs like deciding whether to pack the delivery van early or wait until the end.

### Scripts in `<head>`

Placing a script in the `<head>` is like setting up your tools before the job starts. The script is ready as soon as the page begins loading.

### Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <script>
    function myFunction() {
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Text changed!";
    }
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <p id="demo">This is a paragraph.</p>
  <button onclick="myFunction()">Change Text</button>
</body>
</html>
```

### Scripts in `<body>`

Putting the script in the `<body>` is like waiting until the last minute to load the van. It can speed up the page display because the page doesn‚Äôt wait for the JavaScript to load.

### Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  <p id="demo">This is a paragraph.</p>
  <button onclick="myFunction()">Change Text</button>
  <script>
    function myFunction() {
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Text changed!";
    }
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Which is Better?

Usually, placing scripts at the bottom of the `<body>` is better for performance. It‚Äôs like loading up the delivery van last, so it doesn‚Äôt slow down the rest of the work.

---

## External JavaScript

You can also load your JavaScript from an external file, just like calling for reinforcements from another warehouse. This is super useful when you want to use the same code across multiple pages.

### Example:
```html
<script src="myScript.js"></script>
```

This is like linking to a toolbox stored in a separate file (e.g., `myScript.js`). All your JavaScript lives there, and you just reference it whenever you need it.

### Benefits of External JavaScript:
- **Separation of concerns**: HTML is for structure, JavaScript is for behavior. It‚Äôs like keeping your tools organized by job type.
- **Easier maintenance**: If you need to update the script, you do it in one place. It‚Äôs like updating a central warehouse instead of every delivery van.
- **Faster loading**: Once the browser loads the script file, it can reuse it without loading it again. This is like using the same tools across multiple jobs.

---

## External Script References

You can reference external JavaScript files in three ways:
1. **Full URL**: Think of it as a direct address to a warehouse across the web.
   ```html
   <script src="https://www.example.com/js/myScript.js"></script>
   ```

2. **File path**: This points to a script on the same server, like pulling tools from the local storage room.
   ```html
   <script src="/js/myScript.js"></script>
   ```

3. **No path**: The script is in the same folder as the HTML file, like grabbing a tool from the van itself.
   ```html
   <script src="myScript.js"></script>
   ```

Each method is just another way to organize how you pull in JavaScript, depending on where the file lives.

---

## Conclusion

The `<script>` tag is your tool for bringing JavaScript into your HTML page. Whether you place it in the `<head>`, `<body>`, or use an external file, it's all about how and when you want to load those tools. And remember, organizing your JavaScript in external files helps keep things neat and efficient.

Next time, we‚Äôll dive deeper into **JavaScript functions and events**, which are the real power tools of web development.

# JavaScript Display Possibilities üöÄ

JavaScript gives you several ways to display data on a webpage. Think of JavaScript as a magician that can perform different tricks to show information. Each trick has its own style and purpose. Let‚Äôs dive into these display methods and understand them with simple analogies.

## 1. Writing into an HTML Element with `innerHTML` ‚úçÔ∏è

Imagine you have a whiteboard (the HTML element), and you want to write something on it. JavaScript can grab a marker and write directly on the whiteboard using the `innerHTML` property.

### Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Web Page</h1>
<p>My First Paragraph</p>

<p id="demo"></p> <!-- This is where we'll write -->

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 5 + 6;
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

### Analogy:
`document.getElementById("demo")` is like pointing to a specific whiteboard, and `innerHTML` is the action of writing on it. This is one of the most common ways to update content on a webpage. You just say: "Write this on that board!"

## 2. Writing into the HTML Output with `document.write()` üìù

Imagine you are writing a letter as it‚Äôs being typed out. JavaScript can insert text or content into the webpage as it loads using `document.write()`. But there‚Äôs a catch‚Äîif you try to use this after the letter (page) is already complete, it will erase everything and start a new letter!

### Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Web Page</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

<script>
document.write(5 + 6);
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

### Analogy:
`document.write()` is like writing on a piece of paper while it‚Äôs still coming out of the printer. Once the page is fully printed, using `document.write()` again is like tearing up the page and printing a new one. That‚Äôs why we only use this for testing purposes, not in a fully loaded webpage.

## 3. Displaying Data in an Alert Box with `window.alert()` üîî

This is like tapping someone on the shoulder and showing them a sticky note. When you use `alert()`, it interrupts everything and shows a pop-up with a message.

### Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Web Page</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

<script>
window.alert(5 + 6);
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

### Analogy:
`window.alert()` is the equivalent of loudly saying, ‚ÄúHey! Look at this!‚Äù It halts everything on the page and shows an alert box with your message. You can skip the `window` part, as JavaScript assumes you‚Äôre talking about the global window object.

## 4. Writing to the Console with `console.log()` üõ†Ô∏è

This method is like keeping notes in a personal notebook behind the scenes. You don‚Äôt show this information to users on the webpage; instead, you log it in the browser‚Äôs developer tools, which helps you debug the code.

### Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<script>
console.log(5 + 6);
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

### Analogy:
Think of `console.log()` as a private diary where you keep track of your calculations and thoughts. It‚Äôs not visible to your users, but you can use it to check if your code is running correctly. Super useful for debugging!

## 5. Printing the Page with `window.print()` üñ®Ô∏è

JavaScript doesn't have a direct way to send content to a printer. However, it can ask the browser to print the current webpage using `window.print()`.

### Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<button onclick="window.print()">Print this page</button>

</body>
</html>
```

### Analogy:
`window.print()` is like handing someone a button that says, ‚ÄúPrint this document!‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt control the printer directly, but it triggers the browser‚Äôs print functionality for the user.

---

## Recap üìã
JavaScript has several ways to display data, depending on what you need:
- **`innerHTML`**: Like writing on a whiteboard everyone can see.
- **`document.write()`**: Like writing on a page as it prints‚Äîbe careful, as it can overwrite everything.
- **`window.alert()`**: Like showing a sticky note in front of someone‚Äôs face.
- **`console.log()`**: Like keeping notes in a private diary (useful for debugging).
- **`window.print()`**: Like giving a button to print the current page.

# JavaScript Statements

## What are JavaScript Statements?

In programming, think of a computer program as a recipe. Just like a recipe lists the steps needed to create a dish, a computer program consists of a list of "instructions" that the computer "executes" to perform tasks.

### Example of JavaScript Statements

```javascript
let x, y, z;    // Statement 1
x = 5;          // Statement 2
y = 6;          // Statement 3
z = x + y;      // Statement 4
```

In this example:
- **Statement 1**: We declare three variables: `x`, `y`, and `z`. This is like setting up your ingredients on the table before you start cooking.
- **Statements 2-4**: We assign values to `x` and `y`, and calculate their sum to store in `z`. Each step is executed in order, just like following a recipe.

## JavaScript Programs

A JavaScript program is essentially a collection of statements (instructions) that the web browser executes. When you run a JavaScript program in HTML, the browser interprets these statements to perform actions on the webpage.

### Composition of JavaScript Statements

JavaScript statements are made up of:
- **Values**: The data you work with, like numbers and strings.
- **Operators**: Symbols that perform operations (e.g., `+`, `-`).
- **Expressions**: Combinations of values and operators that produce a value.
- **Keywords**: Reserved words that perform specific actions.
- **Comments**: Notes in the code that are ignored by the browser, used to explain code to other programmers.

For example, the statement below instructs the browser to display "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with the id of "demo":

```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";
```

Just like you follow each instruction in a recipe step by step, JavaScript statements are executed one after the other in the order they are written.

## Semicolons (;)

Semicolons are like periods at the end of sentences in a book. They indicate the end of a statement. It's good practice to add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:

### Examples

```javascript
let a, b, c;  // Declare 3 variables
a = 5;        // Assign the value 5 to a
b = 6;        // Assign the value 6 to b
c = a + b;    // Assign the sum of a and b to c
```

You can also write multiple statements on one line separated by semicolons:

```javascript
a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;
```

While it‚Äôs possible to omit semicolons, it's highly recommended to use them for clarity and to avoid potential issues.

## JavaScript White Space

JavaScript ignores extra spaces, which means you can format your code to make it more readable. 

For example, these two lines are equivalent:

```javascript
let person = "Hege";
let person="Hege";
```

A good practice is to add spaces around operators (e.g., `=`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`):

```javascript
let x = y + z;
```

## JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks

To maintain readability, try to keep your lines under 80 characters. If a statement is too long, break it after an operator:

### Example

```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Hello Dolly!";
```

## JavaScript Code Blocks

JavaScript allows you to group statements together in code blocks using curly braces `{...}`. This helps define statements that should be executed together, similar to how you might group related instructions in a recipe.

### Example of a Function with Code Blocks

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";
  document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "How are you?";
}
```

In this tutorial, we use 2 spaces of indentation for code blocks to enhance readability. You will learn more about functions in later sections.

## JavaScript Keywords

JavaScript statements often start with a keyword, similar to how certain phrases signal the start of instructions in a recipe. Here are some common keywords you‚Äôll encounter:

| Keyword | Description                                     |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `var`   | Declares a variable                             |
| `let`   | Declares a block-scoped variable               |
| `const` | Declares a block-scoped constant               |
| `if`    | Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition |
| `switch`| Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases |
| `for`   | Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop |
| `function`| Declares a function                          |
| `return`| Exits a function                               |
| `try`   | Implements error handling to a block of statements |

Remember, JavaScript keywords are reserved words, meaning you cannot use them as names for variables. Just like you wouldn‚Äôt use a key ingredient as the name for another dish!

## Conclusion

Understanding JavaScript statements is crucial for becoming a proficient frontend developer. Each statement is like a step in a recipe, leading to the final dish‚Äîa dynamic, interactive web application. By practicing these concepts, you‚Äôll be well on your way to mastering JavaScript!

# JavaScript Syntax

JavaScript syntax is the set of rules that dictate how JavaScript programs are constructed. Think of it as the grammar of a language, providing a structure that allows us to communicate effectively with the computer.

### How to Create Variables
```javascript
// Declare variables
var x; // old way of declaring variables
let y; // modern way of declaring variables
```

### How to Use Variables
```javascript
x = 5; // Assigning a value to x
y = 6; // Assigning a value to y
let z = x + y; // Adding x and y to create z
```

---

## JavaScript Values

The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

- **Fixed values**
- **Variable values**

Fixed values are called **Literals**, while variable values are referred to as **Variables**.

### JavaScript Literals

The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:

1. **Numbers** can be written with or without decimals:
   - Example: `10.50`, `1001`
   
2. **Strings** are text, written within double or single quotes:
   - Example: `"John Doe"` or `'John Doe'`

### Analogy
Think of literals as the building blocks of a structure. Just like you can use either bricks (whole numbers) or tiles (decimal numbers) to build a house, you can use both types of literals in your code.

---

## JavaScript Variables

In programming, variables are used to store data values. They are like labeled boxes where you can keep things organized.

JavaScript uses the keywords `var`, `let`, and `const` to declare variables. An equal sign (`=`) is used to assign values to these variables.

### Example
```javascript
let x; // Declaring a variable
x = 6; // Assigning the value 6 to x
```

---

## JavaScript Operators

JavaScript uses **arithmetic operators** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to compute values:

### Example
```javascript
(5 + 6) * 10 // Evaluates to 110
```

Additionally, JavaScript uses an **assignment operator** (`=`) to assign values to variables.

### Example
```javascript
let x, y;
x = 5; // x now holds the value 5
y = 6; // y now holds the value 6
```

### Analogy
Imagine you have a calculator (JavaScript) and numbers (values). The operators are like buttons on the calculator that help you perform operations to get results.

---

## JavaScript Expressions

An **expression** is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value. This process is called **evaluation**.

### Example
```javascript
5 * 10 // Evaluates to 50
x * 10 // Evaluates using the value of x
```

Values can also be strings:
```javascript
"John" + " " + "Doe" // Evaluates to "John Doe"
```

### Analogy
Think of an expression as a recipe. The ingredients (values) and the cooking methods (operators) come together to create a delicious dish (result).

---

## JavaScript Keywords

JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed. 

### Example
The `let` keyword tells the browser to create variables:
```javascript
let x, y;
x = 5 + 6; // 11
y = x * 10; // 110
```

The `var` keyword also tells the browser to create variables but is generally less recommended for modern coding.

### Analogy
Keywords in programming are like verbs in a sentence. They indicate the actions that should be taken.

---

## JavaScript Comments

Not all JavaScript statements are executed. 

Code after double slashes `//` or between `/*` and `*/` is treated as a comment and ignored:

### Example
```javascript
let x = 5;   // This will be executed
// x = 6;   // This will NOT be executed
```

### Analogy
Comments are like footnotes in a book. They provide additional information without affecting the main content.

---

## JavaScript Identifiers / Names

Identifiers are JavaScript names used to name variables, keywords, and functions. The rules for legal names are similar across most programming languages.

A JavaScript name must begin with:

- A letter (A-Z or a-z)
- A dollar sign (`$`)
- An underscore (`_`)

Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs. Importantly, numbers cannot be the first character.

### Analogy
Think of identifiers as labels on storage boxes. They help you identify what's inside without opening them.

---

## JavaScript is Case Sensitive

All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive. 

### Example
The variables `lastName` and `lastname` are two different variables:
```javascript
let lastname, lastName;
lastName = "Doe";
lastname = "Peterson";
```

JavaScript does not interpret `LET` or `Let` as the keyword `let`.

### Analogy
Case sensitivity is like the difference between uppercase and lowercase letters in a password. Both forms are recognized as distinct.

---

## JavaScript and Camel Case

Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:

- **Hyphens** (not allowed): `first-name`, `last-name`
- **Underscore**: `first_name`, `last_name`
- **Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case)**: `FirstName`, `LastName`
- **Lower Camel Case** (most common): `firstName`, `lastName`

### Analogy
Camel case is like creating a name tag with multiple words. Instead of spaces, you capitalize the first letter of each word to keep it neat and readable.

---

## JavaScript Character Set

JavaScript uses the **Unicode** character set, which covers (almost) all characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.

### Analogy
Think of Unicode as a giant library where every possible character is stored. You can find any character you need, no matter how unique or obscure.

---

## Conclusion

Understanding JavaScript syntax is essential for any aspiring frontend developer. It provides the foundation upon which you can build more complex applications. By using analogies, we can relate technical concepts to everyday experiences, making learning more accessible and enjoyable.

---

# JavaScript Comments

In programming, **comments** are like sticky notes you leave for yourself or others. They help explain what the code does, make it easier to read, and are ignored when the code runs. Think of them as instructions that only humans can see.

JavaScript comments are incredibly helpful when you or someone else revisits the code after a while. It's like leaving clues on how the code works, without altering its execution.

## Single Line Comments

A **single-line comment** in JavaScript starts with `//`. Everything written after the `//` on that line will be ignored by JavaScript, just like how you can skip reading the fine print if it doesn't change the main story.

### Example:

```javascript
// Change the heading:
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";

// Change the paragraph:
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
```

In this example, the comments (`// Change the heading`) are notes explaining what the code does. JavaScript will skip over those comments when it runs the code, but they are there to remind us of the purpose of the code.

### Another Example:

You can also add comments at the end of a line to explain what's happening:

```javascript
let x = 5;      // Declare x and assign it the value of 5
let y = x + 2;  // Declare y and assign it the value of x + 2
```

Here, the comments are like small labels you attach to each step, ensuring anyone reading the code understands why these variables were set up the way they were.

## Multi-line Comments

Sometimes you need a bigger sticky note ‚Äî a **multi-line comment**. These start with `/*` and end with `*/`. Everything between those symbols is ignored by JavaScript, even if it spans multiple lines. Think of it as taping a whole paragraph of explanation onto your code.

### Example:

```javascript
/*
The code below will change
the heading with id = "myH"
and the paragraph with id = "myP"
in my web page.
*/
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
```

In this case, the comment is a longer explanation about what the code will do. It‚Äôs like giving detailed instructions for someone who‚Äôs going to read and understand your code.

## Using Comments to Prevent Execution

When testing or debugging, you might want to temporarily "turn off" a piece of code without deleting it. Comments can help with this! By adding `//` at the beginning of a line of code, you turn it into a comment, and JavaScript will no longer execute that line. This is like putting the code on pause.

### Example:

```javascript
//document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
```

Here, the first line has been commented out, so only the second line will run. This is useful when you want to see how your page behaves without a certain piece of code, without permanently removing it.

### Preventing Multiple Lines from Executing

You can use a **multi-line comment** to prevent several lines of code from executing. It‚Äôs like putting multiple things on hold at once.

### Example:

```javascript
/*
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
*/
```

In this case, none of the code between `/*` and `*/` will run. This is useful when you're trying to troubleshoot or experiment with other parts of the code.

---

## Key Takeaways:
- **Single-line comments**: Use `//` to add a short note on a single line.
- **Multi-line comments**: Use `/* ... */` to block out a section of code or leave longer explanations.
- **Prevent execution**: Use comments to temporarily stop a line or section of code from running during tests.

Just like a well-organized workspace with sticky notes and labels, comments help keep your code clean and understandable ‚Äî for you and for anyone else working with it.

# JavaScript Variables

## Variables are Containers for Storing Data

Think of a JavaScript variable as a **box** where you can store different types of items, like numbers, text, or even other boxes. The key is knowing which box holds what item and using the right box at the right time.

In JavaScript, there are different ways to create these "boxes" (variables), and choosing the right one is important for how the program works.

### Ways to Declare Variables in JavaScript

1. **Automatically**: JavaScript is flexible and will sometimes create the box for you, but it's better to be clear and tell it exactly what you want.

    ```javascript
    x = 5;
    y = 6;
    z = x + y;
    ```

    Here, `x`, `y`, and `z` are automatically created by JavaScript. But it‚Äôs like getting a box without labeling it ‚Äì things could get messy!

2. **Using `var`**: This is the older way to declare a variable, like giving a box a name.

    ```javascript
    var x = 5;
    var y = 6;
    var z = x + y;
    ```

    **Note**: `var` was the standard for years, but it has quirks that can lead to unexpected results. It‚Äôs like using an old label maker that sometimes gives you the wrong label.

3. **Using `let`**: This is the modern way to declare variables. It‚Äôs like getting a fresh, clearly labeled box.

    ```javascript
    let x = 5;
    let y = 6;
    let z = x + y;
    ```

4. **Using `const`**: This is like a box you seal shut ‚Äì you can never change what's inside.

    ```javascript
    const x = 5;
    const y = 6;
    const z = x + y;
    ```

    Once `x` and `y` are set with `const`, they stay that way. It's like writing with a permanent marker on your box ‚Äì no erasing or changing.

### Mixed Example

```javascript
const price1 = 5;
const price2 = 6;
let total = price1 + price2;
```

In this case, `price1` and `price2` are constant, so their values can't change. `total`, however, is flexible, and its value can change as needed.

---

## When to Use `var`, `let`, or `const`

- **Always declare variables**: Be clear about what you're doing. Don't let JavaScript guess.
- **Use `const`** when you want something that won‚Äôt change, like constants in a math equation.
- **Use `let`** when the value might change, but you still want control over when and how.
- **Use `var`** only if you're working with old code or browsers.

---

## Analogies for Better Understanding

- **Just Like Algebra**: If you've ever solved an equation like `x + 5 = 10`, you know that `x` is just a placeholder for a value. JavaScript variables work the same way:

    ```javascript
    let x = 5;
    let y = 6;
    let z = x + y;
    ```

    Here, `z` equals 11 because we‚Äôre adding the values of `x` and `y`. Variables act like placeholders or boxes that hold numbers or text.

- **JavaScript Identifiers**: Just like people have names to identify them, JavaScript variables need names too. These names are called **identifiers**, and they must follow certain rules:

    - Names can include letters, digits, underscores (`_`), and dollar signs (`$`).
    - Names must begin with a letter (or `$` or `_`).
    - Names are case-sensitive (e.g., `x` and `X` are different).
    - Reserved words (like `function` or `let`) can‚Äôt be used as variable names.

---

## The Assignment Operator

In JavaScript, the `=` is not the same as the equal sign in math. It‚Äôs more like an arrow that **assigns** a value:

```javascript
x = x + 5;
```

This is saying: "Take the current value of `x`, add 5 to it, and store the result back into `x`." In other words, it updates the box.

- **Note**: If you want to check if two things are equal, use `==` or `===`.

---

## JavaScript Data Types

- **Numbers**: These are values like `100` or `3.14`.
- **Strings**: These are text values, enclosed in quotes, like `"John Doe"` or `'Hello, world!'`.

    ```javascript
    const pi = 3.14;
    let person = "John Doe";
    let answer = 'Yes I am!';
    ```

---

## Declaring a Variable

To create a box (declare a variable), use `var`, `let`, or `const`:

```javascript
let carName = "Volvo";
```

Now, the box labeled `carName` holds the value `"Volvo"`. This value can later be displayed in your webpage, like this:

```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName;
```

---

## One Statement, Many Variables

You can create multiple boxes at once, like this:

```javascript
let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;
```

Or, if you prefer:

```javascript
let person = "John Doe",
    carName = "Volvo",
    price = 200;
```

---

## Value = Undefined

If you declare a variable but don't give it a value, it will be **undefined**. It's like an empty box:

```javascript
let carName;
```

---

## Re-Declaring Variables

If you use `var`, you can re-declare the same variable without losing its value:

```javascript
var carName = "Volvo";
var carName;
```

However, with `let` or `const`, re-declaring is not allowed.

---

## JavaScript Arithmetic and Strings

Just like in algebra, you can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables:

```javascript
let x = 5 + 2 + 3;
```

You can also add strings, but they will be **concatenated** (joined together):

```javascript
let x = "John" + " " + "Doe";
```

If you mix numbers and strings, the numbers will turn into strings and get concatenated too:

```javascript
let x = "5" + 2 + 3;  // x will be "523"
```

---

## The Dollar Sign ($) and Underscore (_)

In JavaScript, both `$` and `_` can be used in variable names, although it's not common practice.

```javascript
let $ = "Hello World";
let _lastName = "Johnson";
```

These symbols are sometimes used by professional developers in libraries like jQuery, where `$` is an alias for selecting elements.

---

# JavaScript Let

The `let` keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015). It is a modern way to declare variables in JavaScript, and it comes with a few important features that help avoid common pitfalls encountered with older declarations.

## Key Features of `let`

- **Block Scope**: Variables declared with `let` have **Block Scope**, meaning they are only accessible within the nearest enclosing `{}` block.
- **Declaration Before Use**: Variables declared with `let` must be declared before they are used.
- **Cannot be Redeclared**: Variables declared with `let` cannot be redeclared in the same scope.

### Block Scope

Before ES6, JavaScript only had **Global Scope** and **Function Scope**. With ES6, two new keywords were introduced: `let` and `const`, both of which provide **Block Scope**.

#### Example:

```javascript
{
  let x = 2;
}
// x can NOT be used here
```

### Global Scope

Variables declared with `var` always have **Global Scope** and can be accessed from outside the block.

#### Example:

```javascript
{
  var x = 2;
}
// x CAN be used here
```

### Cannot be Redeclared

When using `let`, you cannot accidentally redeclare a variable.

#### With `let`, you cannot do this:

```javascript
let x = "John Doe";
let x = 0; // This will cause an error
```

#### But with `var`, you can:

```javascript
var x = "John Doe";
var x = 0; // This is allowed
```

### Redeclaring Variables

Redeclaring a variable using `var` can lead to unexpected behavior. For example:

```javascript
var x = 10; // Here x is 10

{
  var x = 2; // Here x is 2
}

// Here x is 2
```

Using `let`, redeclaring a variable inside a block will not affect the variable outside the block:

```javascript
let x = 10; // Here x is 10

{
  let x = 2; // Here x is 2
}

// Here x is still 10
```

### Difference Between `var`, `let`, and `const`

| Keyword | Scope       | Redeclare | Reassign | Hoisted | Binds this |
|---------|-------------|-----------|----------|---------|------------|
| var     | No          | Yes       | Yes      | Yes     | Yes        |
| let     | Yes         | No        | Yes      | No      | No         |
| const   | Yes         | No        | No       | No      | No         |

### What is Good?

- `let` and `const` have **Block Scope**.
- `let` and `const` cannot be redeclared.
- They must be declared before use.
- They do not bind to `this`.
- They are not hoisted.

### What is Not Good?

- `var` does not have to be declared.
- `var` is hoisted, meaning it can be used before it is declared.
- `var` binds to `this`.

### Browser Support

The `let` and `const` keywords are not supported in Internet Explorer 11 or earlier. Here are the first browser versions with full support:

| Browser  | Version | Release Date |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Chrome   | 49      | Mar, 2016    |
| Edge     | 12      | Jul, 2015    |
| Firefox   | 36      | Jan, 2015    |
| Safari   | 11      | Sep, 2017    |
| Opera    | 36      | Mar, 2016    |

### Redeclaring

Redeclaring a variable with `var` is allowed anywhere in a program:

```javascript
var x = 2; // Now x is 2
var x = 3; // Now x is 3
```

With `let`, redeclaring a variable in the same block is NOT allowed:

```javascript
var x = 2; // Allowed
let x = 3; // Not allowed

{
  let x = 2; // Allowed
  let x = 3; // Not allowed
}
```

However, redeclaring a variable with `let` in another block IS allowed:

```javascript
let x = 2; // Allowed

{
  let x = 3; // Allowed
}

{
  let x = 4; // Allowed
}
```

### Let Hoisting

Variables defined with `var` are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time, meaning you can use the variable before it is declared:

```javascript
carName = "Volvo"; // This is OK
var carName;
```

On the other hand, variables defined with `let` are also hoisted to the top of the block but not initialized. Thus, using a `let` variable before it is declared will result in a `ReferenceError`:

```javascript
carName = "Saab"; // This will cause a ReferenceError
let carName = "Volvo";
```

## Conclusion

Understanding the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const` is essential for writing clean and bug-free JavaScript code. Using `let` and `const` helps prevent errors related to variable redeclaration and scope, making your code more robust.

# JavaScript Const

The `const` keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015) to define variables that are meant to remain constant throughout the program.

## Key Features of const

1. **Cannot be Redeclared**  
   Variables defined with `const` cannot be redeclared within the same scope.

2. **Cannot be Reassigned**  
   Variables defined with `const` cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment.

3. **Block Scope**  
   Variables defined with `const` have block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are declared in.

---

## 1. Cannot be Reassigned

Once a variable is defined with the `const` keyword, you cannot change its value.  

### Example
```javascript
const PI = 3.141592653589793;
PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error
```

### Analogy
Imagine you have a trophy that you won in a competition (the `const` variable). Once you have that trophy, you cannot trade it for a different one (reassign). It‚Äôs yours to keep as a symbol of your achievement.

---

## 2. Must be Assigned

JavaScript `const` variables must be assigned a value at the time of declaration.

### Correct
```javascript
const PI = 3.14159265359;
```

### Incorrect
```javascript
const PI; // SyntaxError
PI = 3.14159265359; // Not allowed
```

### Analogy
Think of `const` as a gift. You can‚Äôt just wrap an empty box and call it a gift; you need to fill it with something (assign a value) at the moment of wrapping (declaration).

---

## 3. When to use JavaScript const?

Always declare a variable with `const` when you know that the value should not be changed. Use `const` when you declare:

- A new Array
- A new Object
- A new Function
- A new RegExp

### Analogy
Imagine you‚Äôre planting a tree (your `const` variable). Once you decide what type of tree it will be (the value), you shouldn‚Äôt change it to another type after it has been planted.

---

## Constant Objects and Arrays

The keyword `const` can be a bit misleading. It does not define a constant value but rather a constant reference to a value.

### You cannot:
- Reassign a constant value
- Reassign a constant array
- Reassign a constant object

### But you can:
- Change the elements of a constant array
- Change the properties of a constant object

### Example of Constant Arrays
```javascript
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

// You can change an element:
cars[0] = "Toyota";

// You can add an element:
cars.push("Audi");
```

#### But you cannot reassign the array:
```javascript
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "Audi"]; // ERROR
```

### Analogy
Think of a `const` array as a toolbox (the reference). You can change the tools inside the box (the elements) but cannot change the box itself for another toolbox (reassign).

---

## Constant Objects

You can change the properties of a constant object:

### Example
```javascript
const car = {type: "Fiat", model: "500", color: "white"};

// You can change a property:
car.color = "red";

// You can add a property:
car.owner = "Johnson";
```

### But you cannot reassign the object:
```javascript
const car = {type: "Fiat", model: "500", color: "white"};
car = {type: "Volvo", model: "EX60", color: "red"}; // ERROR
```

### Analogy
Consider a `const` object like a family photo album (the reference). You can add or change photos (the properties) inside it but you cannot swap out the entire album for a different one (reassign).

---

## Difference Between var, let, and const

| Scope   | Redeclare | Reassign | Hoisted | Binds this |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------|------------|
| var     | No        | Yes      | Yes     | Yes        |
| let     | Yes       | No       | Yes     | No         |
| const   | Yes       | No       | No      | No         |

### What is Good?
- `let` and `const` have block scope.
- `let` and `const` cannot be redeclared.
- `let` and `const` must be declared before use.
- `let` and `const` do not bind to `this`.
- `let` and `const` are not hoisted.

### What is Not Good?
- `var` does not have to be declared.
- `var` is hoisted.
- `var` binds to `this`.

---

## Browser Support

The `let` and `const` keywords are not supported in Internet Explorer 11 or earlier. The following table defines the first browser versions with full support:

| Browser   | Version   | Release Date   |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Chrome    | 49        | Mar, 2016       |
| Edge      | 12        | Jul, 2015       |
| Firefox   | 36        | Jan, 2015       |
| Safari    | 11        | Sep, 2017       |
| Opera     | 36        | Mar, 2016       |

---

## Block Scope

Declaring a variable with `const` is similar to `let` regarding block scope.

### Example
```javascript
const x = 10;
// Here x is 10

{
  const x = 2;
  // Here x is 2
}

// Here x is 10
```

### Analogy
Imagine you are in a room (the block). The rules inside the room (the scope) are different from the rules outside. What happens inside stays inside; the outside world doesn‚Äôt know about it.

---

## Redeclaring

Redeclaring a JavaScript `var` variable is allowed anywhere in a program.

### Example
```javascript
var x = 2;     // Allowed
var x = 3;     // Allowed
x = 4;         // Allowed
```

Redeclaring an existing `var` or `let` variable to `const`, in the same scope, is not allowed:

### Example
```javascript
var x = 2;     // Allowed
const x = 2;   // Not allowed
```

### Analogy
This is like trying to change a permanent marker's writing on a whiteboard (redeclaration of `const`). You can write as much as you want (use `var`), but once you've made a statement with a permanent marker (used `const`), you cannot erase it or write over it in the same spot.

---

## Hoisting

Variables defined with `var` are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time, meaning you can use the variable before it is declared:

### Example
```javascript
carName = "Volvo";
var carName; // This is OK
```

Variables defined with `const` are also hoisted to the top, but not initialized, which means using a `const` variable before it is declared will result in a `ReferenceError`:

### Example
```javascript
alert(carName); // ReferenceError
const carName = "Volvo";
```

### Analogy
Imagine hoisting as a magic trick where the name tag (variable) is brought to the front of the stage (top of the scope). When using `var`, the name is just there waiting to be filled in, while `const` requires you to fill it in first before anyone can call out the name.

---

# JavaScript Operators

JavaScript operators are used to perform different types of mathematical and logical computations, much like tools in a toolbox that help you build and fix things. 

## Examples

- The **Assignment Operator** `=` assigns values
- The **Addition Operator** `+` adds values
- The **Multiplication Operator** `*` multiplies values
- The **Comparison Operator** `>` compares values

---

## JavaScript Assignment

The Assignment Operator (`=`) assigns a value to a variable, like giving a name tag to a box so you know what‚Äôs inside.

### Assignment Examples

```javascript
let x = 10; // We have a box named 'x' that contains the value 10
// Assign the value 5 to x
x = 5; // Now the box 'x' contains the value 5
// Assign the value 2 to y
let y = 2; // We have another box named 'y' with value 2
// Assign the value x + y to z
let z = x + y; // Box 'z' now contains the value 7 (5 + 2)
```

---

## JavaScript Addition

The Addition Operator (`+`) adds numbers, just like combining apples and oranges into one basket.

### Adding

```javascript
let x = 5; // 5 apples
let y = 2; // 2 oranges
let z = x + y; // We now have 7 fruits in total
```

---

## JavaScript Multiplication

The Multiplication Operator (`*`) multiplies numbers, similar to finding out how many pieces of fruit are in several baskets.

### Multiplying

```javascript
let x = 5; // 5 baskets
let y = 2; // Each basket has 2 pieces of fruit
let z = x * y; // We have 10 pieces of fruit in total
```

---

## Types of JavaScript Operators

There are different types of JavaScript operators, much like different categories of tools:

- **Arithmetic Operators**
- **Assignment Operators**
- **Comparison Operators**
- **String Operators**
- **Logical Operators**
- **Bitwise Operators**
- **Ternary Operators**
- **Type Operators**

---

## JavaScript Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers, like a calculator.

### Arithmetic Operators Example

```javascript
let a = 3; // Base number
let x = (100 + 50) * a; // (150) * 3 = 450
```

| Operator | Description                           |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| `+`      | Addition                              |
| `-`      | Subtraction                           |
| `*`      | Multiplication                        |
| `**`     | Exponentiation (ES2016)              |
| `/`      | Division                              |
| `%`      | Modulus (Division Remainder)         |
| `++`     | Increment                             |
| `--`     | Decrement                             |

*Note: Arithmetic operators are fully described in the JS Arithmetic chapter.*

---

## JavaScript Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables, like adding ingredients to a recipe.

### Assignment

```javascript
let x = 10; // Starting amount
x += 5; // Add 5 to the current amount of x (x = x + 5)
```

| Operator | Example   | Same As       |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| `=`      | `x = y`   | `x = y`       |
| `+=`     | `x += y`  | `x = x + y`   |
| `-=`     | `x -= y`  | `x = x - y`   |
| `*=`     | `x *= y`  | `x = x * y`   |
| `/=`     | `x /= y`  | `x = x / y`   |
| `%=`     | `x %= y`  | `x = x % y`   |
| `**=`    | `x **= y` | `x = x ** y`  |

*Note: Assignment operators are fully described in the JS Assignment chapter.*

---

## JavaScript Comparison Operators

Comparison Operators compare values, similar to a judge evaluating different entries in a competition.

| Operator | Description                           |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| `==`     | equal to                              |
| `===`    | equal value and equal type           |
| `!=`     | not equal                             |
| `!==`    | not equal value or not equal type    |
| `>`      | greater than                          |
| `<`      | less than                             |
| `>=`     | greater than or equal to              |
| `<=`     | less than or equal to                |
| `?`      | ternary operator                      |

*Note: Comparison operators are fully described in the JS Comparisons chapter.*

---

## JavaScript String Comparison

All the comparison operators can also be used on strings, like sorting names in alphabetical order.

### Example

```javascript
let text1 = "A"; // First name
let text2 = "B"; // Second name
let result = text1 < text2; // true, because "A" comes before "B"
```

Strings are compared alphabetically, so "20" is less than "5" because it compares character by character.

### Example

```javascript
let text1 = "20"; // String "20"
let text2 = "5";  // String "5"
let result = text1 < text2; // false
```

---

## JavaScript String Addition

The `+` operator can also be used to concatenate strings, similar to joining two pieces of rope.

### Example

```javascript
let text1 = "John"; // First name
let text2 = "Doe";  // Last name
let text3 = text1 + " " + text2; // "John Doe"
```

The `+=` operator can also concatenate strings:

```javascript
let text1 = "What a very ";
text1 += "nice day"; // "What a very nice day"
```

---

## Adding Strings and Numbers

Adding two numbers returns the sum, but adding a number and a string will return a string, like mixing paint colors.

### Example

```javascript
let x = 5 + 5;       // 10
let y = "5" + 5;     // "55"
let z = "Hello" + 5; // "Hello5"
```

If you add a number and a string, the result will be a string!

---

## JavaScript Logical Operators

Logical operators are like the conditions you set for a game, determining whether a move is valid.

| Operator | Description                           |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| `&&`     | logical and                          |
| `||`     | logical or                           |
| `!`      | logical not                          |

*Note: Logical operators are fully described in the JS Comparisons chapter.*

---

## JavaScript Type Operators

Type operators help identify what kind of data you're dealing with, much like labeling different boxes.

| Operator       | Description                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `typeof`       | Returns the type of a variable                |
| `instanceof`   | Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type |

*Note: Type operators are fully described in the JS Type Conversion chapter.*

---

## JavaScript Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators work on 32-bit numbers, manipulating data at the binary level, like turning on and off switches.

| Operator | Description             | Example        | Result | Decimal |
|----------|-------------------------|----------------|--------|---------|
| `&`      | AND                     | `5 & 1`        | `0001` | 1       |
| `|`      | OR                      | `5 | 1`        | `0101` | 5       |
| `~`      | NOT                     | `~ 5`          | `1010` | -6      |
| `^`      | XOR                     | `5 ^ 1`        | `0100` | 4       |
| `<<`     | left shift              | `5 << 1`       | `1010` | 10      |
| `>>`     | right shift             | `5 >> 1`       | `0010` | 2       |
| `>>>`    | unsigned right shift     | `5 >>> 1`      | `0010` | 2       |

*Note: Bitwise operators are fully described in the JS Bitwise chapter.*

# JavaScript Arithmetic

## JavaScript Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic on numbers (literals or variables). Think of these operators as different tools in a toolbox, each designed to perform a specific mathematical task. 

| Operator | Description                      |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| `+`      | Addition                         |
| `-`      | Subtraction                      |
| `*`      | Multiplication                   |
| `**`     | Exponentiation (ES2016)         |
| `/`      | Division                         |
| `%`      | Modulus (Remainder)             |
| `++`     | Increment                        |
| `--`     | Decrement                        |

## Arithmetic Operations

A typical arithmetic operation operates on two numbers. You can think of this as a recipe that combines two ingredients to create a dish.

The two numbers can be literals:

```javascript
let x = 100 + 50; // Using literal values
```

Or variables:

```javascript
let a = 20;
let b = 30;
let x = a + b; // Using variables
```

Or expressions:

```javascript
let x = (100 + 50) * a; // Using an expression
```

## Operators and Operands

The numbers in an arithmetic operation are called **operands**. The operation performed between these operands is defined by an **operator**. Think of operands as the ingredients and operators as the instructions on how to mix those ingredients.

```
Operand	Operator	Operand
100	    +	    50
```

### Adding

The addition operator (`+`) adds numbers together. It's like combining two fruits to make a fruit salad:

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x + y; // z is now 7
```

### Subtracting

The subtraction operator (`-`) subtracts numbers. Think of it as taking one item away from a group:

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x - y; // z is now 3
```

### Multiplying

The multiplication operator (`*`) multiplies numbers. Imagine you have several baskets, and each basket has the same number of apples:

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x * y; // z is now 10
```

### Dividing

The division operator (`/`) divides numbers. Picture slicing a cake into equal pieces:

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x / y; // z is now 2.5
```

### Remainder

The modulus operator (`%`) returns the remainder of a division. It's like figuring out how many full baskets of fruit you can make, and how many are left over:

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x % y; // z is now 1
```

In arithmetic, dividing two integers produces a quotient and a remainder. In mathematics, the result of a modulo operation is the remainder from a division.

### Incrementing

The increment operator (`++`) increases a number by one. Think of it as adding one more cookie to your cookie jar:

```javascript
let x = 5;
x++; // x is now 6
```

### Decrementing

The decrement operator (`--`) decreases a number by one. Imagine taking one cookie out of your jar:

```javascript
let x = 5;
x--; // x is now 4
```

### Exponentiation

The exponentiation operator (`**`) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand. It‚Äôs like planting a seed that grows into a tree, which then produces more seeds:

```javascript
let x = 5;
let z = x ** 2; // z is now 25
```

This can also be expressed using the `Math.pow` function:

```javascript
let z = Math.pow(x, 2); // z is now 25
```

## Operator Precedence

Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression. This is like having a set of rules for which tasks to complete first in a recipe.

```javascript
let x = 100 + 50 * 3; // Is the result equal to 150 * 3, or 100 + 150?
```

Just like in school mathematics, multiplication is done first. The multiplication (`*`) and division (`/`) operators have a higher precedence than addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`).

You can change the precedence by using parentheses:

```javascript
let x = (100 + 50) * 3; // Here, the addition is done first
```

When many operations have the same precedence (like addition and subtraction, or multiplication and division), they are computed from left to right:

```javascript
let x = 100 + 50 - 3; // Adds first, then subtracts
let x = 100 / 50 * 3; // Divides first, then multiplies
```

# JavaScript Assignment

## JavaScript Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables. Think of them as a way to set up your workspace by giving each tool (variable) a specific value.

| Operator | Example      | Same As       |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| =        | `x = y`     | `x = y`       |
| +=       | `x += y`    | `x = x + y`   |
| -=       | `x -= y`    | `x = x - y`   |
| *=       | `x *= y`    | `x = x * y`   |
| /=       | `x /= y`    | `x = x / y`   |
| %=       | `x %= y`    | `x = x % y`   |
| **=      | `x **= y`   | `x = x ** y`  |

### Shift Assignment Operators

These operators are like moving items left or right on a shelf. You‚Äôre just changing their positions.

| Operator | Example      | Same As       |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| <<=      | `x <<= y`    | `x = x << y`  |
| >>=      | `x >>= y`    | `x = x >> y`  |
| >>>=     | `x >>>= y`   | `x = x >>> y` |

### Bitwise Assignment Operators

These operators perform bit-level operations, similar to flipping switches on a control panel.

| Operator | Example      | Same As       |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| &=       | `x &= y`     | `x = x & y`   |
| ^=       | `x ^= y`     | `x = x ^ y`   |
| |=       | `x |= y`     | `x = x | y`   |

### Logical Assignment Operators

Think of these operators as making decisions. They decide whether to keep the current value or update it based on conditions.

| Operator | Example      | Same As                 |
|----------|--------------|-------------------------|
| &&=      | `x &&= y`    | `x = x && (x = y)`     |
| ||=      | `x ||= y`    | `x = x || (x = y)`     |
| ??=      | `x ??= y`    | `x = x ?? (x = y)`     |

> **Note:** The Logical assignment operators are a feature introduced in ES2020.

## The `=` Operator

The simple assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. Imagine labeling a box with its contents.

### Simple Assignment Examples
```javascript
let x = 10; // Box labeled 'x' with value 10
let y = 5;  // Box labeled 'y' with value 5
let z = x + y; // Box 'z' now contains the sum of 'x' and 'y'
```

## The `+=` Operator

The addition assignment operator adds a value to a variable. Picture it as adding more items to an already filled box.

### Addition Assignment Examples
```javascript
let x = 10; // Box 'x' contains 10
x += 5;     // Now box 'x' contains 15 (10 + 5)
let text = "Hello"; 
text += " World"; // Now box 'text' contains "Hello World"
```

## The `-=` Operator

The subtraction assignment operator subtracts a value from a variable. It's like removing some items from a box.

### Subtraction Assignment Example
```javascript
let x = 10; // Box 'x' contains 10
x -= 5;     // Now box 'x' contains 5 (10 - 5)
```

## The `*=` Operator

The multiplication assignment operator multiplies a variable. Imagine duplicating the contents of a box several times.

### Multiplication Assignment Example
```javascript
let x = 10; // Box 'x' contains 10
x *= 5;     // Now box 'x' contains 50 (10 * 5)
```

## The `**=` Operator

The exponentiation assignment operator raises a variable to the power of the operand. Think of it as a box that grows exponentially with each use.

### Exponentiation Assignment Example
```javascript
let x = 10; // Box 'x' contains 10
x **= 2;    // Now box 'x' contains 100 (10^2)
```

## The `/=` Operator

The division assignment operator divides a variable. This is like sharing the contents of a box among several others.

### Division Assignment Example
```javascript
let x = 10; // Box 'x' contains 10
x /= 5;     // Now box 'x' contains 2 (10 / 5)
```

## The `%=` Operator

The remainder assignment operator assigns a remainder to a variable. Imagine splitting candies and keeping the leftovers.

### Remainder Assignment Example
```javascript
let x = 10; // Box 'x' contains 10
x %= 3;     // Now box 'x' contains 1 (10 % 3)
```

## The `<<=` Operator

The left shift assignment operator shifts the bits of a variable to the left. Picture it as moving items further down a shelf.

### Left Shift Assignment Example
```javascript
let x = -100; // Box 'x' contains -100
x <<= 5;      // Now box 'x' is shifted left (multiplied by 2^5)
```

## The `>>=` Operator

The right shift assignment operator shifts the bits of a variable to the right. Think of it as moving items closer to the edge of a shelf.

### Right Shift Assignment Example
```javascript
let x = -100; // Box 'x' contains -100
x >>= 5;      // Now box 'x' is shifted right (divided by 2^5)
```

## The `>>>=` Operator

The unsigned right shift assignment operator shifts the bits of a variable to the right without keeping the sign. This is like moving items without considering their original position.

### Unsigned Right Shift Assignment Example
```javascript
let x = -100; // Box 'x' contains -100
x >>>= 5;     // Now box 'x' is shifted right without sign consideration
```

## The `&=` Operator

The bitwise AND assignment operator performs a bitwise AND operation on two operands and assigns the result. This is like keeping only the items that are common between two boxes.

### Bitwise AND Assignment Example
```javascript
let x = 10; // Box 'x' contains 10
x &= 5;     // Now box 'x' contains 0 (10 & 5)
```

## The `|=` Operator

The bitwise OR assignment operator performs a bitwise OR operation on two operands and assigns the result. This is akin to combining the items from two boxes.

### Bitwise OR Assignment Example
```javascript
let x = 10; // Box 'x' contains 10
x |= 5;     // Now box 'x' contains 15 (10 | 5)
```

## The `^=` Operator

The bitwise XOR assignment operator performs a bitwise XOR operation on two operands and assigns the result. Imagine you keep only the unique items from two boxes.

### Bitwise XOR Assignment Example
```javascript
let x = 10; // Box 'x' contains 10
x ^= 5;     // Now box 'x' contains 15 (10 ^ 5)
```

## The `&&=` Operator

The logical AND assignment operator assigns the second value if the first value is true. It‚Äôs like deciding to fill a box only if it‚Äôs already occupied.

### Logical AND Assignment Example
```javascript
let x = 10; // Box 'x' contains 10
x &&= 5;    // Box 'x' remains 10 (10 && 5 is true, x doesn't change)
```

## The `||=` Operator

The logical OR assignment operator assigns the second value if the first value is false. This is like saying, "If this box is empty, put something in it."

### Logical OR Assignment Example
```javascript
let x; // Box 'x' is empty
x ||= 5; // Now box 'x' contains 5 (x was empty)
```

## The `??=` Operator

The nullish coalescing assignment operator assigns the second value if the first value is null or undefined. Think of it as filling a box with something if it has nothing in it.

### Nullish Coalescing Assignment Example
```javascript
let x; // Box 'x' is empty
x ??= 5; // Now box 'x' contains 5 (x was null/undefined)
```

> **Note:** The `??=` operator is a feature introduced in ES2020.

# JavaScript Data Types

JavaScript has **8 Data Types**:

1. **String**
2. **Number**
3. **BigInt**
4. **Boolean**
5. **Undefined**
6. **Null**
7. **Symbol**
8. **Object**

---

## The Object Datatype

The **Object** data type is like a versatile toolbox that can hold various tools (values) and gadgets (functions). In JavaScript, objects can include built-in types as well as user-defined objects. Here are some examples:

### Built-in Object Types
- **Objects**: Think of a toolbox containing a variety of tools.
- **Arrays**: Like a shelf that holds different items (elements) in a specific order.
- **Dates**: A calendar that helps you track time.
- **Maps/Sets**: Like labeled containers for organizing items.
- **IntArrays/FloatArrays**: Special boxes for holding numbers, either whole or with decimal points.
- **Promises**: A commitment to fulfill a task in the future.

### Examples
```javascript
// Numbers:
let length = 16;  // Length of an item in centimeters
let weight = 7.5; // Weight of the item in kilograms

// Strings:
let color = "Yellow";       // Color of the item
let lastName = "Johnson";   // Person's last name

// Booleans
let x = true;   // This value indicates 'yes'
let y = false;  // This value indicates 'no'

// Object:
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"}; // Represents a person with properties

// Array object:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]; // A shelf of car names

// Date object:
const date = new Date("2022-03-25"); // A date in the calendar
```

**Note**: A JavaScript variable can hold any type of data, like a toolbox that can change its tools as needed.

---

## The Concept of Data Types

In programming, **data types** are crucial for effective operation. Knowing the type of a variable is essential because it defines how you can manipulate it. 

### Why Data Types Matter
Consider this example:

```javascript
let x = 16 + "Volvo"; // Mixing a number and a string
```

Does it make sense to add "Volvo" to the number 16? Without data types, JavaScript cannot process this safely. It will treat the above example like this:

```javascript
let x = "16" + "Volvo"; // Converts 16 into a string
```

**Note**: When adding a number and a string, JavaScript treats the number as a string.

### Sequence Matters
JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can lead to different results:

```javascript
let x = 16 + 4 + "Volvo"; // Result: "20Volvo"
let y = "Volvo" + 16 + 4; // Result: "Volvo164"
```

In the first example, JavaScript treats 16 and 4 as numbers until it reaches "Volvo". In the second, it treats everything as strings.

---

## JavaScript Types are Dynamic

JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning you can use the same variable to hold different types of data at different times.

### Example
```javascript
let x;       // x is undefined
x = 5;       // Now x is a Number
x = "John";  // Now x is a String
```

This flexibility is like using the same backpack for different items ‚Äî it can change its contents based on what you need.

---

## JavaScript Strings

A **string** is like a sentence made up of characters. Strings are enclosed in quotes, either single or double.

### Examples
```javascript
// Using double quotes:
let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";

// Using single quotes:
let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';
```

You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the surrounding quotes:

```javascript
let answer1 = "It's alright"; // Single quote inside double quotes
let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'"; // Single quotes inside double quotes
let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"'; // Double quotes inside single quotes
```

---

## JavaScript Numbers

All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal (floating-point) values. They can be written with or without decimals.

### Examples
```javascript
// With decimals:
let x1 = 34.00;

// Without decimals:
let x2 = 34;
```

### Exponential Notation
Extra large or small numbers can be represented in scientific notation:

```javascript
let y = 123e5;    // 12300000
let z = 123e-5;   // 0.00123
```

**Note**: JavaScript numbers are always treated as double (64-bit floating point).

---

## JavaScript BigInt

**BigInt** is a new datatype (ES2020) that allows you to store large integers that cannot be represented by a regular JavaScript Number.

### Example
```javascript
let x = BigInt("123456789012345678901234567890");
```

---

## JavaScript Booleans

**Booleans** represent truth values and can only be true or false. They are essential for making decisions in code.

### Example
```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 5;
let z = 6;

(x == y)       // Returns true
(x == z)       // Returns false
```

---

## JavaScript Arrays

Arrays are like shelves that store a collection of items (values). They are defined with square brackets.

### Example
```javascript
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]; // A shelf of car names
```

Array items are zero-indexed, meaning the first item is at position 0.

---

## JavaScript Objects

Objects are like boxes that hold multiple related items. They are defined with curly braces `{}`.

### Example
```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
}; // A box containing properties of a person
```

---

## The typeof Operator

The `typeof` operator is a useful tool to find the type of a variable in JavaScript.

### Example
```javascript
typeof "";             // Returns "string"
typeof 0;              // Returns "number"
```

---

## Undefined

A variable without a value has the value **undefined**. 

### Example
```javascript
let car;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined
car = undefined;    // Value is still undefined
```

---

## Empty Values

An **empty value** has a legal type, while **undefined** does not. An empty string is still considered a string.

### Example
```javascript
let car = "";    // The value is "", the typeof is "string"
```

---

# JavaScript Functions

## Introduction to Functions

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. Think of a function as an appliance in your kitchen: each one has a different function, like mixing, cooking, or blending. When you need to do a task, you simply use the appropriate appliance.

### Function Execution

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes (calls) it. Just like when you decide to use an appliance, you turn it on and put it to work to accomplish what you need.

### Example

```javascript
// Function to compute the product of p1 and p2
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;
}
```

---

## JavaScript Function Syntax

A function is defined with the `function` keyword, followed by a name and then parentheses `()`. 

### Function Naming Rules

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, following the same rules as variables.

The parameters of the function are listed inside the parentheses `()` in the function definition:

```javascript
function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses `()` in the function definition.

Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked. Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) act as local variables, just like having specific tools for each task.

---

## Function Invocation

The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes it. This can happen in different scenarios:

- **When an event occurs** (when a user clicks a button).
- **When it is invoked** (called) from JavaScript code.
- **Automatically** (self-invoked).

### Invocation Example

```javascript
// The function is called, the return value will end up in x
let x = myFunction(4, 3);
```

---

## Function Return

When JavaScript reaches a `return` statement, the function will stop executing. If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will return to execute the code that follows the invoking statement.

Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller".

### Example

```javascript
function myFunction(a, b) {
  // The function returns the product of a and b
  return a * b;
}
```

---

## Why Use Functions?

Functions allow you to reuse code. You can write code that can be used multiple times, like a recipe you can follow over and over again with different ingredients (arguments) to get different results.

---

## The () Operator

The `()` operator invokes (calls) the function. It‚Äôs like pressing the start button on an appliance to make it begin working.

### Example: Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius

```javascript
function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
  return (5 / 9) * (fahrenheit - 32);
}

let value = toCelsius(77);
```

Accessing a function with incorrect parameters can return an incorrect answer.

### Error Example

```javascript
let value = toCelsius(); // This can cause an error because no argument was passed
```

Accessing a function without `()` returns the function itself, not the result of the function.

### Reference Example

```javascript
let value = toCelsius; // Refers to the function object, not the result
```

---

## Functions Used as Variable Values

Functions can be used like variables in formulas, assignments, and calculations. 

### Direct Use Example

Instead of using a variable to store the return value of a function:

```javascript
let x = toCelsius(77);
let text = "The temperature is " + x + " Celsius";
```

You can use the function directly as a variable value:

```javascript
let text = "The temperature is " + toCelsius(77) + " Celsius";
```

---

## Local Variables

Variables declared within a JavaScript function become LOCAL to that function. This is similar to having a workspace where only you can access your tools.

### Local Variable Example

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  let carName = "Volvo"; // Local variable
  // code here CAN use carName
}

// outside the function, you cannot use carName
```

Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, you can use variables with the same name in different functions.

Local variables are created when a function starts and deleted when the function completes.

---

# JavaScript Objects

## Real Life Objects

In real life, objects are things like houses, cars, people, animals, or any other subjects. Just as a car has specific characteristics and functions, JavaScript objects encapsulate related data and behaviors.

### Car Object Example

| Car Object | Properties                       | Methods                      |
|------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
|            | car.name = Fiat                 | car.start()                  |
|            | car.model = 500                 | car.drive()                  |
|            | car.weight = 850kg              | car.brake()                  |
|            | car.color = white                | car.stop()                   |

---

## Object Properties

A real-life car has properties like weight and color:

- `car.name = Fiat`
- `car.model = 500`
- `car.weight = 850kg`
- `car.color = white`

Car objects have the same properties, but the values differ from car to car, just like how every car has its own unique specifications.

---

## Object Methods

A real-life car has methods like start and stop:

- `car.start()`
- `car.drive()`
- `car.brake()`
- `car.stop()`

Car objects have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times, like starting your car in the morning or braking at a stoplight.

---

## JavaScript Variables

JavaScript variables are containers for data values. They are like jars where you can store ingredients to use later.

### Example

```javascript
let car = "Fiat";
```

---

## JavaScript Objects

Objects are variables too. But unlike simple variables, objects can contain many values. They can be thought of as complex jars that can hold various ingredients.

### Example

```javascript
const car = {type: "Fiat", model: "500", color: "white"};
```

**Note:** It is a common practice to declare objects with the `const` keyword for readability and to prevent accidental reassignments.

---

## JavaScript Object Definition

### How to Define a JavaScript Object

There are several ways to define a JavaScript object:

1. **Using an Object Literal**
2. **Using the new Keyword**
3. **Using an Object Constructor**

### JavaScript Object Literal

An object literal is a list of name:value pairs inside curly braces `{}`.

```javascript
{firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age: 50, eyeColor: "blue"}
```

**Note:** Name:value pairs are also called key:value pairs.

---

### Creating a JavaScript Object

These examples create a JavaScript object with 4 properties:

#### Example 1: Object Literal

```javascript
// Create an Object
const person = {firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age: 50, eyeColor: "blue"};
```

Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object initializer can span multiple lines:

#### Example 2: Multi-line Object

```javascript
// Create an Object
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};
```

#### Example 3: Empty Object and Adding Properties

This example creates an empty JavaScript object, and then adds 4 properties:

```javascript
// Create an Object
const person = {};

// Add Properties
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = "blue";
```

### Using the new Keyword

This example creates a new JavaScript object using `new Object()`, and then adds 4 properties:

```javascript
// Create an Object
const person = new Object();

// Add Properties
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = "blue";
```

**Note:** The examples above do exactly the same. However, using `new Object()` is less common. For readability, simplicity, and execution speed, it's best to use the object literal method.

---

## Object Properties

The named values in JavaScript objects are called properties.

| Property    | Value  |
|-------------|--------|
| firstName   | John   |
| lastName    | Doe    |
| age         | 50     |
| eyeColor    | blue   |

Objects written as name-value pairs are similar to:

- Associative arrays in PHP
- Dictionaries in Python
- Hash tables in C
- Hash maps in Java
- Hashes in Ruby and Perl

---

## Accessing Object Properties

You can access object properties in two ways:

1. `objectName.propertyName`
2. `objectName["propertyName"]`

### Examples

```javascript
person.lastName; // Accessing using dot notation
person["lastName"]; // Accessing using bracket notation
```

## JavaScript Object Methods

Methods are actions that can be performed on objects. They are like buttons on a car that initiate certain actions.

### Example

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  id: 5566,
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};
```

In the example above, `this` refers to the person object:

- `this.firstName` means the `firstName` property of `person`.
- `this.lastName` means the `lastName` property of `person`.

---

## In JavaScript, Objects are King

If you understand objects, you understand JavaScript. Objects are containers for properties and methods.

- **Properties** are named values.
- **Methods** are functions stored as properties.

Properties can be primitive values, functions, or even other objects. In JavaScript, almost everything is an object, including:

- Objects
- Math
- Functions
- Dates
- Arrays
- Maps
- Sets

All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.

---

## JavaScript Primitives

A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.

For example, `3.14` is a primitive value.

### Primitive Data Types

JavaScript defines 7 types of primitive data types:

- string
- number
- boolean
- null
- undefined
- symbol
- bigint

### Immutability of Primitives

Primitive values are immutable; they cannot be changed. 

| Value   | Type     | Comment                  |
|---------|----------|--------------------------|
| "Hello" | string   | "Hello" is always "Hello"|
| 3.14    | number   | 3.14 is always 3.14      |
| true    | boolean  | true is always true       |
| false   | boolean  | false is always false     |
| null    | null     | null is always null       |
| undefined| undefined| undefined is always undefined|

---

## JavaScript Objects are Mutable

Objects are mutable: they are addressed by reference, not by value. 

If `person` is an object, the following statement will not create a copy of `person`:

```javascript
const x = person;
```

The object `x` is not a copy of `person`; it refers to the same object. Therefore, any changes to `x` will also affect `person`:

### Example

```javascript
// Create an Object
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};

// Create a copy
const x = person;

// Change Age in both
x.age = 10; // Changes the age for both x and person
```

---

# JavaScript Object Properties

## An Object is an Unordered Collection of Properties

Imagine an object in JavaScript as a toolbox. Inside this toolbox, you have different tools (properties) that you can use. Each tool has a name (key) and a specific purpose (value). Properties are the most important part of JavaScript objects.

- **Properties:** They are like tools in the toolbox. They can be changed, added, deleted, and some are read-only.

## Accessing JavaScript Properties

The syntax for accessing the property of an object is as follows:

1. **Using Dot Notation:**

   ```javascript
   // objectName.property
   let age = person.age;
   ```

   Think of this as using a tool from your toolbox. By mentioning the name of the toolbox (object) and then the name of the tool (property), you get the tool you need.

2. **Using Bracket Notation:**

   ```javascript
   // objectName["property"]
   let age = person["age"];
   ```

   Here, you‚Äôre using a label (property name) to access the tool inside the toolbox. This is useful if the name of the tool has spaces or special characters.

3. **Using Expressions:**

   ```javascript
   // objectName[expression]
   let age = person[x];
   ```

   In this case, `x` is a variable that stores the name of the tool, allowing you to access it dynamically.

### Examples

```javascript
person.firstname + " is " + person.age + " years old."; // Dot notation
person["firstname"] + " is " + person["age"] + " years old."; // Bracket notation
let x = "firstname";
let y = "age";
person[x] + " is " + person[y] + " years old."; // Using variables
```

## Adding New Properties

You can add new properties to an existing object by simply giving it a value:

### Example

```javascript
person.nationality = "English"; // Adding a new property
```

Think of this as adding a new tool to your toolbox. Now you have more options to work with.

## Deleting Properties

The `delete` keyword is used to remove a property from an object:

### Example

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};

delete person.age; // Deleting a property
```

You can also use bracket notation:

```javascript
delete person["age"];
```

### Note:

The `delete` keyword removes both the value of the property and the property itself. After deletion, you cannot use the property until it is added back again.

## Nested Objects

Property values in an object can be other objects. This is like having tools within tools in your toolbox.

### Example

```javascript
myObj = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  myCars: {
    car1: "Ford",
    car2: "BMW",
    car3: "Fiat"
  }
};
```

You can access nested objects using dot notation or bracket notation:

### Examples

```javascript
myObj.myCars.car2;           // Dot notation
myObj.myCars["car2"];       // Bracket notation
myObj["myCars"]["car2"];    // Nested access
let p1 = "myCars";
let p2 = "car2";
myObj[p1][p2];              // Using variables to access
```

## Complete Object Reference

For a complete reference, you can consult our:

### [Complete JavaScript Object Reference](#)

The reference contains descriptions and examples of all object properties and methods.

## Conclusion

Understanding how object properties work in JavaScript is essential for managing data and creating dynamic applications. As you progress in your learning, remember that objects are powerful tools in your JavaScript toolbox, ready to help you build whatever you desire.

# JavaScript Object Methods

## What are Object Methods?

Object methods are like actions that you can perform on objects. Imagine an object as a smartphone, and methods are the applications (apps) that perform specific tasks on that smartphone. For instance, you can use a messaging app to send messages, or a photo app to take pictures.

A method is essentially a function definition stored as a property value within the object.

### Example of an Object with Methods

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  id: 5566,
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName; // Combines first and last name
  }
};
```

In this example:
- `firstName`, `lastName`, and `id` are properties of the `person` object.
- `fullName` is a method that combines the `firstName` and `lastName` properties.

### Understanding `this`

In the context of methods, `this` refers to the object on which the method is being called. 

- `this.firstName` means the `firstName` property of the `person` object.
- `this.lastName` means the `lastName` property of the `person` object.

## Accessing Object Methods

You can access an object method using the following syntax:

```javascript
objectName.methodName();
```

### Example

When you invoke the `fullName` property with parentheses, it executes as a function:

```javascript
let name = person.fullName(); // Executes the method and returns "John Doe"
```

If you access the `fullName` property without parentheses, it returns the function definition itself:

```javascript
let name = person.fullName; // Returns the function definition
```

## Adding a Method to an Object

You can easily add a new method to an existing object:

### Example

```javascript
person.name = function () {
  return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName; // Another way to get the full name
};
```

Now, the `person` object has an additional method `name` that does the same thing as `fullName`.

## Using JavaScript Methods

You can also utilize built-in JavaScript methods within your object methods. For example, you can use the `toUpperCase()` method to convert text to uppercase:

### Example

```javascript
person.name = function () {
  return (this.firstName + " " + this.lastName).toUpperCase(); // Returns "JOHN DOE"
};
```

In this case, the `name` method now returns the full name in uppercase letters.

## Conclusion

Understanding object methods in JavaScript is essential for building interactive and dynamic applications. Methods allow you to perform actions on your objects, similar to how apps function on a smartphone. As you continue your journey in JavaScript, remember that mastering methods is crucial for efficient coding and problem-solving.

# Displaying Objects in JavaScript

## How to Display JavaScript Objects?

When you try to display a JavaScript object directly, the result will be `[object Object]`, which is not very informative. It's like trying to describe a box without opening it: you can only see its exterior.

### Example of Creating an Object

```javascript
// Create an Object
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York"
};

// Attempt to display the object directly
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = person; // Result: [object Object]
```

To display an object more informatively, there are several solutions:

1. **Displaying the Object Properties by Name**
2. **Displaying the Object Properties in a Loop**
3. **Displaying the Object using `Object.values()`**
4. **Displaying the Object using `JSON.stringify()`**

## Displaying Object Properties

You can display the properties of an object as a string:

### Example

```javascript
// Create an Object
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York"
};

// Display Properties
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
  person.name + ", " + person.age + ", " + person.city;
```

### Displaying Properties in a Loop

The properties of an object can be collected using a loop:

### Example

```javascript
// Create an Object
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York"
};

// Build a Text
let text = "";
for (let x in person) {
  text += person[x] + " "; // Concatenate the values
}

// Display the Text
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;
```

**Note:** You must use `person[x]` in the loop. Using `person.x` will not work because `x` is the loop variable.

## Using `Object.values()`

`Object.values()` creates an array from the property values of the object:

### Example

```javascript
// Create an Object
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York"
};

// Create an Array
const myArray = Object.values(person);

// Display the Array
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myArray; // Displays: John, 30, New York
```

## Using `Object.entries()`

`Object.entries()` makes it easier to work with objects in loops:

### Example

```javascript
const fruits = { Bananas: 300, Oranges: 200, Apples: 500 };

let text = "";
for (let [fruit, value] of Object.entries(fruits)) {
  text += fruit + ": " + value + "<br>"; // Concatenate fruit name and quantity
}
```

## Using `JSON.stringify()`

JavaScript objects can be converted to a string using the JSON method `JSON.stringify()`. This method is built into JavaScript and is supported in all major browsers.

### Example

```javascript
// Create an Object
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York"
};

// Stringify Object
let myString = JSON.stringify(person); // {"name":"John","age":30,"city":"New York"}

// Display String
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myString;
```

**Note:** The result will be a string written in JSON notation.

## Conclusion

Understanding how to display objects in JavaScript is essential for debugging and providing clear information to users. Whether through specific properties, loops, or methods like `Object.values()` and `JSON.stringify()`, there are multiple ways to present data effectively.

# JavaScript Object Constructors

## Object Constructor Functions

Sometimes we need to create many objects of the same type. To achieve this, we use an **object constructor function**. 

It is considered good practice to name constructor functions with an upper-case first letter, which helps to distinguish them from regular functions.

### Object Type: Person

```javascript
function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  this.age = age;
  this.eyeColor = eye;
}
```

**Note:** In the constructor function, `this` has no value until a new object is created. The value of `this` will become the new object.

### Creating New Objects

Now we can use `new Person()` to create many new `Person` objects:

```javascript
const myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
const myMother = new Person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");
const mySister = new Person("Anna", "Rally", 18, "green");
const mySelf = new Person("Johnny", "Rally", 22, "green");
```

## Property Default Values

A value assigned to a property will be a default value for all objects created by the constructor:

### Example

```javascript
function Person(first, last, age, eyecolor) {
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  this.age = age;
  this.eyeColor = eyecolor;
  this.nationality = "English"; // Default value
}
```

### Adding a Property to an Object

Adding a property to an object created by the constructor is straightforward:

```javascript
myFather.nationality = "English"; // Assign nationality to myFather
```

**Note:** The new property will be added to `myFather`, not to any other `Person` objects.

## Adding a Property to a Constructor

You cannot add a new property directly to an object constructor. 

### Example

```javascript
Person.nationality = "English"; // This will not work
```

To add a new property, you must add it to the constructor function prototype:

### Example

```javascript
Person.prototype.nationality = "English"; // Add nationality to prototype
```

## Constructor Function Methods

A constructor function can also have methods defined within it:

### Example

```javascript
function Person(first, last, age, eyecolor) {
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  this.age = age;
  this.eyeColor = eyecolor;
  this.fullName = function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  };
}
```

### Adding a Method to an Object

You can easily add a method to a created object:

```javascript
myMother.changeName = function(name) {
  this.lastName = name; // Change last name
}
```

**Note:** The new method will be added to `myMother`, not to any other `Person` objects.

## Adding a Method to a Constructor

You cannot add a new method to an object constructor function directly. The following code will produce a `TypeError`:

### Example

```javascript
Person.changeName = function(name) {
  this.lastName = name; // This will not work
}

// Trying to use the method will cause an error
myMother.changeName("Doe"); // TypeError: myMother.changeName is not a function
```

To add a new method, it must be done to the constructor function prototype:

### Example

```javascript
Person.prototype.changeName = function(name) {
  this.lastName = name; // Change last name
}

myMother.changeName("Doe"); // Works correctly now
```

**Note:** The `changeName()` function assigns the value of `name` to the person's `lastName` property, with `this` referring to `myMother`.

## Built-in JavaScript Constructors

JavaScript has built-in constructors for all native objects:

- `new Object()`   // A new Object object
- `new Array()`    // A new Array object
- `new Map()`      // A new Map object
- `new Set()`      // A new Set object
- `new Date()`     // A new Date object
- `new RegExp()`   // A new RegExp object
- `new Function()` // A new Function object

**Note:** The `Math` object is not a constructor. `Math` is a global object, and you cannot use the `new` keyword on `Math`.

## Did You Know?

- Use object literals `{}` instead of `new Object()`.
- Use array literals `[]` instead of `new Array()`.
- Use regex literals `/()/` instead of `new RegExp()`.
- Use function expressions `() => {}` instead of `new Function()`.

### Example of Primitive Types

```javascript
"";           // primitive string
0;            // primitive number
false;        // primitive boolean

{};           // object object
[];           // array object
/()/          // regexp object
function(){}; // function
```

# JavaScript Events

HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, it can "react" to these events.

## HTML Events

An HTML event can be something the browser does or something a user does. Here are some examples of HTML events:

- An HTML web page has finished loading
- An HTML input field was changed
- An HTML button was clicked

Often, when events happen, you may want to do something. JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected. HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

### Analogy: The Steering Wheel of a Ship

Imagine your web page is a ship sailing in the sea. The events are like waves that affect the ship's movement. When the ship faces a wave (an event), you can turn the steering wheel (execute code) to react to that wave and keep the ship on the right course.

### Example of Event Attributes

With single quotes:
```html
<element event='some JavaScript'>
```

With double quotes:
```html
<element event="some JavaScript">
```

In the following example, an `onclick` attribute (with code) is added to a `<button>` element:

#### Example 1

```html
<button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">What time is it?</button>
```

In the example above, the JavaScript code changes the content of the element with `id="demo"`.

#### Example 2

In the next example, the code changes the content of its own element (using `this.innerHTML`):

```html
<button onclick="this.innerHTML = Date()">What time is it?</button>
```

JavaScript code is often several lines long. It's more common to see event attributes calling functions:

#### Example 3

```html
<button onclick="displayDate()">What time is it?</button>
```

## Common HTML Events

Here is a list of some common HTML events:

| Event       | Description                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `onchange`  | An HTML element has been changed                 |
| `onclick`   | The user clicks an HTML element                  |
| `onmouseover`| The user moves the mouse over an HTML element   |
| `onmouseout`| The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element |
| `onkeydown` | The user pushes a keyboard key                   |
| `onload`    | The browser has finished loading the page        |

The list is much longer: [W3Schools JavaScript Reference HTML DOM Events](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp).

### Analogy: The Controls of a Car

Imagine HTML events are like actions you take while driving a car. When you press the accelerator (event), the car reacts (executes a function) by speeding up. Similarly, when an event occurs on your web page, you can make your code react to perform a specific action.

## JavaScript Event Handlers

Event handlers can be used to handle and verify user input, user actions, and browser actions. Some of the things that can be done include:

- Actions that should be done every time a page loads
- Actions that should be performed when the page is closed
- Actions that should be executed when a user clicks a button
- Content that should be verified when a user inputs data
- And more...

### Common Methods for Working with Events in JavaScript:

- HTML event attributes can execute JavaScript code directly.
- HTML event attributes can call JavaScript functions.
- You can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements.
- You can prevent events from being sent or being handled.
- And more...

You will learn much more about events and event handlers in the HTML DOM chapters.

### Conclusion

Events are fundamental for interaction on web pages. Understanding how they work and how to react to them will allow you to create more dynamic and engaging web applications.

# JavaScript Strings

Strings are for storing text. They are written with quotes.

## Using Quotes

A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.

### Example

```javascript
let text = "John Doe";
```

You can use single or double quotes:

### Example

```javascript
let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";  // Double quotes
let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';  // Single quotes
```

**Note:** Strings created with single or double quotes work the same. There is no difference between the two.

### Analogy: A Book Cover

Think of strings as the covers of books. Just like a book can have a cover made of different materials (paper or cloth), a string can be enclosed in single or double quotes. The content inside the cover (the text) remains the same, no matter the type of cover used.

## Quotes Inside Quotes

You can use quotes inside a string as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:

### Example

```javascript
let answer1 = "It's alright";
let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';
```

### Analogy: Nested Boxes

Imagine you have a box (the outer quotes) that contains another smaller box (the inner quotes). As long as you don‚Äôt use the same type of box for both, everything fits perfectly without confusion.

## Template Strings

Templates were introduced with ES6 (JavaScript 2016). Templates are strings enclosed in backticks (`` `This is a template string` ``).

Templates allow single and double quotes inside a string:

### Example

```javascript
let text = `He's often called "Johnny"`;
```

**Note:** Templates are not supported in Internet Explorer.

### Analogy: A Flexible Envelope

Templates are like flexible envelopes that can hold various shapes and sizes of letters (quotes). They can accommodate all kinds of content without worrying about what type of envelope (quote) you're using.

## String Length

To find the length of a string, use the built-in `length` property:

### Example

```javascript
let text = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
let length = text.length;
```

### Analogy: Measuring a Rope

Think of a string as a rope. Just as you can measure the length of a rope, you can measure how many characters are in a string.

## Escape Characters

Because strings must be written within quotes, JavaScript will misunderstand this string:

```javascript
let text = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.";
```

The string will be chopped to `"We are the so-called "`.

To solve this problem, you can use a backslash escape character. The backslash escape character (`\`) turns special characters into string characters:

### Escape Sequences

| Code | Result    | Description         |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| `\'` | `'`       | Single quote        |
| `\"` | `"`       | Double quote        |
| `\\` | `\`       | Backslash           |
| `\b` | (Backspace) | Backspace         |
| `\f` | (Form Feed) | Form Feed         |
| `\n` | (New Line) | New Line           |
| `\r` | (Carriage Return) | Carriage Return |
| `\t` | (Horizontal Tab) | Horizontal Tab |
| `\v` | (Vertical Tab) | Vertical Tab     |

### Analogy: Special Characters in a Movie Script

Imagine you‚Äôre writing a movie script. The backslash is like a director‚Äôs cue that tells the actors how to deliver special lines (like quotes) without disrupting the flow of the script (the string).

### Examples

```javascript
let text = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";  // Inserts a double quote
let text = 'It\'s alright.';                                     // Inserts a single quote
let text = "The character \\ is called backslash.";             // Inserts a backslash
```

## Breaking Long Lines

For readability, programmers often like to avoid long code lines. A safe way to break up a statement is after an operator:

### Example

```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Hello Dolly!";
```

A safe way to break up a string is by using string addition:

### Example

```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello " +
"Dolly!";
```

## JavaScript Strings as Objects

Normally, JavaScript strings are primitive values, created from literals:

```javascript
let x = "John";
```

But strings can also be defined as objects with the keyword `new`:

```javascript
let y = new String("John");
```

### **Caution:** Avoid String Objects

**Do not create String objects.** The `new` keyword complicates the code and slows down execution speed. String objects can produce unexpected results:

### Comparison Example

```javascript
let x = "John";
let y = new String("John");

console.log(x == y);  // true
console.log(x === y); // false
```

### Analogy: Two Ways to Introduce Yourself

Introducing yourself can be done in two ways: casually saying, "Hi, I'm John" (primitive string) or presenting a formal ID card stating, "I am John" (string object). While they may refer to the same person, the ID card (string object) adds unnecessary complexity.

---

# JavaScript String Methods

## Basic String Methods
JavaScript strings are primitive and immutable: All string methods produce a new string without altering the original string.

### String length
The `length` property returns the length of a string:

```javascript
let text = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
let length = text.length;
```

### Extracting String Characters
There are 4 methods for extracting string characters:

- **The `at(position)` Method**
- **The `charAt(position)` Method**
- **The `charCodeAt(position)` Method**
- **Using property access `[]` like in arrays**

### JavaScript String `charAt()`
The `charAt()` method returns the character at a specified index (position) in a string:

```javascript
let text = "HELLO WORLD";
let char = text.charAt(0);
```

### JavaScript String `charCodeAt()`
The `charCodeAt()` method returns the code of the character at a specified index in a string. The method returns a UTF-16 code (an integer between 0 and 65535).

```javascript
let text = "HELLO WORLD";
let char = text.charCodeAt(0);
```

### JavaScript String `at()`
ES2022 introduced the string method `at()`:

Examples:

Get the third letter of the name:

```javascript
const name = "W3Schools";
let letter = name.at(2);
```

Get the third letter of the name:

```javascript
const name = "W3Schools";
let letter = name[2];
```

The `at()` method allows the use of negative indexes while `charAt()` does not. For example, you can now use `myString.at(-2)` instead of `charAt(myString.length - 2)`.

### Browser Support
The `at()` method is a new addition to JavaScript and is supported in all modern browsers since March 2023:

| Browser  | Version  |
|----------|----------|
| Chrome   | 94       |
| Edge     | 94       |
| Firefox   | 93      |
| Safari   | 16.4     |
| Opera    | 79       |

### Property Access `[]`
Example:

```javascript
let text = "HELLO WORLD";
let char = text[0];
```

**Note:** Property access might be a little unpredictable:
- It makes strings look like arrays (but they are not).
- If no character is found, `[]` returns `undefined`, while `charAt()` returns an empty string.
- It is read-only. For example, `str[0] = "A"` gives no error (but does not work!).

### Extracting String Parts
There are 3 methods for extracting a part of a string:

- `slice(start, end)`
- `substring(start, end)`
- `substr(start, length)`

### JavaScript String `slice()`
`slice()` extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string. It takes 2 parameters: start position and end position (end not included).

Example: Slice out a portion of a string from position 7 to position 13:

```javascript
let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = text.slice(7, 13);
```

**Note:** JavaScript counts positions from zero, meaning:
- The first position is 0.
- The second position is 1.

If you omit the second parameter, the method will slice out the rest of the string:

```javascript
let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = text.slice(7);
```

If a parameter is negative, the position is counted from the end of the string:

```javascript
let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = text.slice(-12);
```

This example slices out a portion of a string from position -12 to position -6:

```javascript
let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = text.slice(-12, -6);
```

### JavaScript String `substring()`
`substring()` is similar to `slice()`, but the difference is that start and end values less than 0 are treated as 0.

Example:

```javascript
let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = str.substring(7, 13);
```

### JavaScript String `substr()`
`substr()` is similar to `slice()`, but the difference is that the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part.

Example:

```javascript
let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = str.substr(7, 6);
```

If you omit the second parameter, `substr()` will slice out the rest of the string.

Example:

```javascript
let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = str.substr(7);
```

If the first parameter is negative, the position counts from the end of the string.

Example:

```javascript
let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = str.substr(-4);
```

### Converting to Upper and Lower Case
A string is converted to upper case with `toUpperCase()`:

A string is converted to lower case with `toLowerCase()`:

#### JavaScript String `toUpperCase()`
Example:

```javascript
let text1 = "Hello World!";
let text2 = text1.toUpperCase();
```

#### JavaScript String `toLowerCase()`
Example:

```javascript
let text1 = "Hello World!";       // String
let text2 = text1.toLowerCase();  // text2 is text1 converted to lower
```

### JavaScript String `concat()`
`concat()` joins two or more strings:

Example:

```javascript
let text1 = "Hello";
let text2 = "World";
let text3 = text1.concat(" ", text2);
```

The `concat()` method can be used instead of the plus operator. These two lines do the same:

```javascript
text = "Hello" + " " + "World!";
text = "Hello".concat(" ", "World!");
```

**Note:** All string methods return a new string. They don't modify the original string. Formally said: Strings are immutable: Strings cannot be changed, only replaced.

### JavaScript String `trim()`
The `trim()` method removes whitespace from both sides of a string:

Example:

```javascript
let text1 = "      Hello World!      ";
let text2 = text1.trim();
```

### JavaScript String `trimStart()`
ECMAScript 2019 added the String method `trimStart()` to JavaScript. The `trimStart()` method works like `trim()`, but removes whitespace only from the start of a string.

Example:

```javascript
let text1 = "     Hello World!     ";
let text2 = text1.trimStart();
```

### JavaScript String `trimEnd()`
ECMAScript 2019 added the string method `trimEnd()` to JavaScript. The `trimEnd()` method works like `trim()`, but removes whitespace only from the end of a string.

Example:

```javascript
let text1 = "     Hello World!     ";
let text2 = text1.trimEnd();
```

### JavaScript String Padding
ECMAScript 2017 added two new string methods to JavaScript: `padStart()` and `padEnd()` to support padding at the beginning and at the end of a string.

#### JavaScript String `padStart()`
The `padStart()` method pads a string from the start. It pads a string with another string (multiple times) until it reaches a given length.

Example: Pad a string with "0" until it reaches the length 4:

```javascript
let text = "5";
let padded = text.padStart(4, "0");
```

Example: Pad a string with "x" until it reaches the length 4:

```javascript
let text = "5";
let padded = text.padStart(4, "x");
```

**Note:** The `padStart()` method is a string method. To pad a number, convert the number to a string first.

Example:

```javascript
let numb = 5;
let text = numb.toString();
let padded = text.padStart(4, "0");
```

### Browser Support
`padStart()` is an ECMAScript 2017 feature. ES2017 is supported in all modern browsers since September 2017:

| Browser  | Version  |
|----------|----------|
| Chrome   | 58       |
| Edge     | 15       |
| Firefox  | 52       |
| Safari   | 11       |
| Opera    | 45       |

### JavaScript String `padEnd()`
The `padEnd()` method pads a string from the end. It pads a string with another string (multiple times) until it reaches a given length.

Example:

```javascript
let text = "5";
let padded = text.padEnd(4, "0");
```

Example:

```javascript
let text = "5";
let padded = text.padEnd(4, "x");
```

**Note:** The `padEnd()` method is a string method. To pad a number, convert the number to a string first.

Example:

```javascript
let numb = 5;
let text = numb.toString();
let padded = text.padEnd(4, "0");
```

### Browser Support
`padEnd()` is an ECMAScript 2017 feature. ES2017 is supported in all modern browsers since September 2017:

| Browser  | Version  |
|----------|----------|
| Chrome   | 58      

 |
| Edge     | 15       |
| Firefox  | 52       |
| Safari   | 11       |
| Opera    | 45       |

### Searching a String
The `indexOf()` and `lastIndexOf()` methods are used to search for a string in another string.

### JavaScript String `indexOf()`
The `indexOf()` method returns the first index (position) of a specified value in a string.

Example:

```javascript
let text = "HELLO WORLD";
let position = text.indexOf("O");
```

### JavaScript String `lastIndexOf()`
The `lastIndexOf()` method returns the last index (position) of a specified value in a string.

Example:

```javascript
let text = "HELLO WORLD";
let position = text.lastIndexOf("O");
```

### JavaScript String `search()`
The `search()` method searches for a match between a regular expression and a string. It returns the index of the first match found, or -1 if no match was found.

Example:

```javascript
let text = "HELLO WORLD";
let position = text.search("W");
```

### JavaScript String `replace()`
The `replace()` method replaces a specified value with another value in a string. The `replace()` method returns a new string.

Example:

```javascript
let text = "HELLO WORLD";
let newText = text.replace("WORLD", "EVERYONE");
```

### JavaScript String `replaceAll()`
The `replaceAll()` method replaces all occurrences of a specified value in a string with another value. The `replaceAll()` method returns a new string.

Example:

```javascript
let text = "HELLO WORLD";
let newText = text.replaceAll("O", "X");
```

### JavaScript String `split()`
The `split()` method splits a string into an array of substrings.

Example:

```javascript
let text = "APPLE, BANANA, KIWI";
let fruits = text.split(", ");
```

### JavaScript String `includes()`
The `includes()` method checks whether a string contains a specified value, returning true or false.

Example:

```javascript
let text = "HELLO WORLD";
let isPresent = text.includes("WORLD");
```

### JavaScript String `startsWith()`
The `startsWith()` method checks whether a string starts with a specified value, returning true or false.

Example:

```javascript
let text = "HELLO WORLD";
let isStarting = text.startsWith("HELLO");
```

### JavaScript String `endsWith()`
The `endsWith()` method checks whether a string ends with a specified value, returning true or false.

Example:

```javascript
let text = "HELLO WORLD";
let isEnding = text.endsWith("WORLD");
```

## Conclusion
JavaScript strings are an essential part of programming. Understanding these string methods will help you manipulate strings effectively, improving your coding efficiency.

# JavaScript String Search

## Introduction
Searching through strings in JavaScript is like looking for a book in a library. We use different tools and methods to find what we need. Below, we will explore several methods that allow us to locate text within strings.

## String Search Methods
- `String indexOf()`
- `String lastIndexOf()`
- `String search()`
- `String match()`
- `String matchAll()`
- `String includes()`
- `String startsWith()`
- `String endsWith()`

## JavaScript String indexOf()
The `indexOf()` method is like a librarian who tells you which shelf a book is on for the first time. It returns the index (position) of the first occurrence of a string in another string or -1 if the string is not found.

### Example
```javascript
let text = "Please locate where 'locate' occurs!";
let index = text.indexOf("locate"); // index will be 7
```

**Note:** JavaScript counts positions from zero. Therefore, 0 is the first position in a string, 1 is the second, and so on.

## JavaScript String lastIndexOf()
The `lastIndexOf()` method is like a librarian who tells you which shelf a book is on, but searching from the end to the beginning. It returns the index of the last occurrence of a specified text.

### Example
```javascript
let text = "Please locate where 'locate' occurs!";
let index = text.lastIndexOf("locate"); // index will be 7
```

Both methods (`indexOf()` and `lastIndexOf()`) return -1 if the text is not found.

### Searching from a Specific Position
Both methods accept a second parameter that indicates the position to start the search.

### Example
```javascript
let index = text.indexOf("locate", 15); // index will be -1
```

## JavaScript String search()
The `search()` method is like a detective searching for a keyword in a book. It returns the position of the match of a string or a regular expression.

### Example
```javascript
let text = "Please locate where 'locate' occurs!";
let index = text.search("locate"); // index will be 7
```

### Comparison with `indexOf()`
Both methods accept similar arguments and return similar values, but there are differences:
- `search()` does not accept a second argument.
- `indexOf()` cannot take powerful search values (regular expressions).

## JavaScript String match()
The `match()` method is like an exam that evaluates whether there are matches of a pattern in text. It returns an array with the results.

### Example
```javascript
let text = "The rain in SPAIN stays mainly in the plain";
let matches = text.match("ain"); // ["ain"]
```

### Global Search
```javascript
let matches = text.match(/ain/g); // ["ain", "ain", "ain"]
```

## JavaScript String matchAll()
The `matchAll()` method is like a group of detectives searching for all matches in a book. It returns an iterator with all the results.

### Example
```javascript
const iterator = text.matchAll(/ain/g);
```

**Note:** `matchAll()` is an ES2020 feature and does not work in Internet Explorer.

## JavaScript String includes()
The `includes()` method is like asking if a store has a specific product. It returns `true` if the string contains a specified value and `false` otherwise.

### Example
```javascript
let text = "Hello world, welcome to the universe.";
let hasWorld = text.includes("world"); // true
```

## JavaScript String startsWith()
The `startsWith()` method is like checking if a book starts with a certain phrase. It returns `true` if the string begins with a specified value.

### Example
```javascript
let text = "Hello world, welcome to the universe.";
let startsWithHello = text.startsWith("Hello"); // true
```

## JavaScript String endsWith()
The `endsWith()` method is like checking if a book ends with a certain phrase. It returns `true` if the string ends with a specified value.

### Example
```javascript
let text = "John Doe";
let endsWithDoe = text.endsWith("Doe"); // true
```

## Conclusion
Understanding how to search and manipulate strings in JavaScript is essential for working with data. These methods are powerful tools that will allow you to access and modify information efficiently. As you progress on your journey as a frontend developer, mastering these techniques will be crucial.

# JavaScript Template Strings

## Introduction
JavaScript Template Strings are like versatile containers that allow you to create and manipulate strings with ease. They offer various features that make string handling simpler and more powerful.

## String Templates
### Template Strings
Template Strings, also known as Template Literals, are like modern kitchen tools that help you prepare meals more efficiently. They make it easier to cook up strings, especially when you need to mix different ingredients (variables, expressions) together.

### Beloved Child Has Many Names
Template Strings go by multiple names‚ÄîTemplate Strings and Template Literals. They refer to the same concept, so don't be surprised if you hear both terms used interchangeably.

## Back-Ticks Syntax
Template Strings use back-ticks (``) instead of regular quotes ("" or ''). This is like using a special type of bowl to mix ingredients that can hold more than just one flavor.

### Example
```javascript
let text = `Hello World!`;
```

## Quotes Inside Strings
One of the perks of Template Strings is that they allow both single and double quotes inside the string. This is like having a universal recipe that can handle various spices without losing flavor.

### Example
```javascript
let text = `He's often called "Johnny"`;
```

## Multiline Strings
Template Strings can span multiple lines, allowing you to write longer passages without worrying about concatenation. This is like having a large canvas to paint a beautiful landscape instead of being confined to a small piece of paper.

### Example
```javascript
let text =
`The quick
brown fox
jumps over
the lazy dog`;
```

## Interpolation
Template Strings provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings. This technique is known as **string interpolation**, which allows you to blend various elements seamlessly.

### Variable Substitutions
Template Strings allow you to incorporate variables directly into the string, just like adding ingredients to your dish for a richer flavor.

### Example
```javascript
let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Doe";

let text = `Welcome ${firstName}, ${lastName}!`; // Welcome John, Doe!
```

The automatic replacement of variables with their real values is what we call string interpolation.

### Expression Substitution
You can also embed expressions within Template Strings, which is like adding a complex ingredient that transforms your dish into something extraordinary.

### Example
```javascript
let price = 10;
let VAT = 0.25;

let total = `Total: ${(price * (1 + VAT)).toFixed(2)}`; // Total: 12.50
```

This process of automatically replacing expressions with their real values is also known as string interpolation.

## HTML Templates
Template Strings can be particularly useful for generating HTML dynamically. They simplify the creation of complex structures, just like an efficient recipe helps you combine ingredients to create a masterpiece.

### Example
```javascript
let header = "Template Strings";
let tags = ["template strings", "javascript", "es6"];

let html = `<h2>${header}</h2><ul>`;
for (const x of tags) {
  html += `<li>${x}</li>`;
}
html += `</ul>`;
```

## Browser Support
Template Strings are an ES6 feature (JavaScript 2015). They are fully supported in all modern browsers since June 2017:

| Browser     | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| Chrome      | 51      |
| Edge        | 15      |
| Firefox     | 54      |
| Safari      | 10      |
| Opera       | 38      |

**Note:** Template Strings are not supported in Internet Explorer.

## Conclusion
JavaScript Template Strings are powerful tools that simplify string handling in programming. By using back-ticks, allowing quotes inside strings, supporting multiline text, and enabling easy interpolation, they make it easier to create dynamic and complex strings in your applications.

# JavaScript Numbers

## Introduction
JavaScript has only one type of number, which makes it straightforward to work with numerical data. You can write numbers with or without decimals, much like you can have a fruit smoothie with or without chunks of fruit.

### Example
```javascript
let x = 3.14;    // A number with decimals
let y = 3;       // A number without decimals
```

## Scientific Notation
When dealing with extra large or small numbers, JavaScript uses scientific (exponent) notation, similar to how we might refer to a huge mountain in terms of height rather than counting each tiny rock.

### Example
```javascript
let x = 123e5;    // This means 12300000
let y = 123e-5;   // This means 0.00123
```

## 64-bit Floating Point
In JavaScript, all numbers are stored as double precision floating point numbers according to the IEEE 754 standard. This is like having a high-quality camera that captures every detail in 64 different shades of color.

- **Value (Fraction/Mantissa):** Stored in bits 0 to 51.
- **Exponent:** Stored in bits 52 to 62.
- **Sign:** Stored in bit 63.

## Integer Precision
Integers, which are numbers without a decimal point, are accurate up to 15 digits. Think of it as having a measuring tape that can only measure lengths up to 15 centimeters without losing precision.

### Example
```javascript
let x = 999999999999999;   // x will be 999999999999999
let y = 9999999999999999;  // y will be 10000000000000000 (lost precision)
```

## Floating Point Precision
Floating point arithmetic isn't always perfectly accurate. This is similar to measuring ingredients in cooking, where a small difference in the amount can affect the taste of the dish.

### Example
```javascript
let x = 0.2 + 0.1; // Not exactly 0.3
```

To work around this issue, you can multiply and divide to retain precision.

### Example
```javascript
let x = (0.2 * 10 + 0.1 * 10) / 10; // Correctly results in 0.3
```

## Adding Numbers and Strings
JavaScript uses the `+` operator for both addition and concatenation. It's like a multitool that can serve both as a knife for cutting (adding numbers) and a spoon for mixing (concatenating strings).

### Numeric Addition
If you add two numbers, the result is a number.

### Example
```javascript
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = x + y; // z will be 30
```

### String Concatenation
If you add two strings, the result is a concatenation of those strings.

### Example
```javascript
let x = "10";
let y = "20";
let z = x + y; // z will be "1020"
```

### Number and String Addition
If you mix a number with a string, the result will still be a string concatenation. This is like trying to pour a cup of water into a bowl of cereal‚Äîit combines in a way you might not expect!

### Examples
```javascript
let x = 10;
let y = "20";
let z = x + y; // z will be "1020"

let a = "10";
let b = 20;
let c = a + b; // c will be "1020"
```

### Common Mistakes
It‚Äôs common to expect results that don‚Äôt align with JavaScript's behavior due to left-to-right execution.

#### Example of Misleading Addition
```javascript
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = "The result is: " + x + y; // z will be "The result is: 1020"
```

The interpreter first calculates `10 + 20`, then concatenates the string, leading to confusion.

## Numeric Strings
JavaScript recognizes strings that contain numeric content and will attempt to convert them to numbers in numeric operations, just like a chef using measurements on a label.

### Working Examples
```javascript
let x = "100";
let y = "10";
let z = x / y; // z will be 10

let a = "100";
let b = "10";
let c = a * b; // c will be 1000

let d = "100";
let e = "10";
let f = d - e; // f will be 90
```

However, using `+` will concatenate the strings.

### Example
```javascript
let x = "100";
let y = "10";
let z = x + y; // z will be "10010"
```

## NaN - Not a Number
`NaN` is a special value that indicates a result is not a legal number. Think of it as a "no entry" sign for mathematical operations.

### Example
```javascript
let x = 100 / "Apple"; // x will be NaN
```

If the string is numeric, the result will be a valid number.

### Example
```javascript
let x = 100 / "10"; // x will be 10
```

You can use the global function `isNaN()` to check for `NaN`.

### Example
```javascript
let x = 100 / "Apple";
isNaN(x); // returns true
```

If you perform a mathematical operation with `NaN`, the result will also be `NaN`.

### Example
```javascript
let x = NaN;
let y = 5;
let z = x + y; // z will be NaN
```

Or it might result in a strange concatenation like `NaN5`.

### Example
```javascript
let x = NaN;
let y = "5";
let z = x + y; // z will be "NaN5"
```

Interestingly, `NaN` is still considered a number in JavaScript:

### Example
```javascript
typeof NaN; // returns "number"
```

## Infinity
Infinity (or -Infinity) is returned when a calculation exceeds the largest possible number, like trying to measure the height of a mountain that's too tall to exist!

### Example
```javascript
let myNumber = 2;
while (myNumber != Infinity) {
  myNumber = myNumber * myNumber; // Eventually reaches Infinity
}
```

Division by zero also produces Infinity:

### Example
```javascript
let x =  2 / 0; // x will be Infinity
let y = -2 / 0; // y will be -Infinity
```

Like `NaN`, `Infinity` is also a number:

### Example
```javascript
typeof Infinity; // returns "number"
```

## Hexadecimal
In JavaScript, numbers can be written in hexadecimal format by prefixing them with `0x`, similar to using a different language to represent colors.

### Example
```javascript
let x = 0xFF; // 255 in decimal
```

Be cautious with leading zeros; they can sometimes lead to unexpected interpretations.

## Number Base Conversions
JavaScript displays numbers in base 10 by default. However, you can convert them to various bases using the `toString()` method.

### Example
```javascript
let myNumber = 32;
myNumber.toString(2);  // Converts to binary (base 2)
myNumber.toString(8);  // Converts to octal (base 8)
myNumber.toString(10); // Converts to decimal (base 10)
myNumber.toString(16); // Converts to hexadecimal (base 16)
```

## JavaScript Numbers as Objects
Normally, JavaScript numbers are primitive values. But they can also be defined as objects using the `new` keyword, much like turning a basic tool into a specialized instrument.

### Example
```javascript
let x = 123;          // Primitive value
let y = new Number(123); // Object
```

### Warning: Avoid Creating Number Objects
Creating Number objects complicates your code and slows down execution speed. It's generally advised to stick with primitive values.

When using the `==` operator, objects can behave unexpectedly.

### Example
```javascript
let x = 500;
let y = new Number(500);
console.log(x == y); // true, because the values are equal
console.log(x === y); // false, because they are different types
```

Comparing two Number objects always returns false.

### Example
```javascript
let a = new Number(500);
let b = new Number(500);
console.log(a === b); // false, different objects
```

## Conclusion
Understanding JavaScript Numbers is essential for any frontend developer. By grasping how numbers work, including precision, operations, and special values like `NaN` and `Infinity`, you can better handle numerical data in your applications.

# JavaScript BigInt: A Traveler in the World of Large Numbers

## Introduction to BigInt
JavaScript BigInt is a special data type used to store very large integer values that cannot be represented by a normal JavaScript Number.

### Analogy
Imagine you have a toolbox. Normal numbers are like a regular screwdriver: they work for most tasks, but if you need a giant screwdriver (a really large number), you need a special tool, which is BigInt.

## Integer Precision in JavaScript
JavaScript integers are only accurate up to 15 digits:

```javascript
let x = 999999999999999; // Accurate
let y = 9999999999999999; // Not accurate
```

In JavaScript, all numbers are stored in a 64-bit floating-point format (IEEE 754 standard). This means large numbers cannot be represented accurately and are rounded.

### Analogy
It‚Äôs like a clock that can only show up to 12 hours. If you try to set it to 15 hours, the clock will reset to 3. Similarly, large numbers are "rounded" to fit this format.

### Safe Integer Range
JavaScript can safely represent integers:

- Up to **9007199254740991** ( \(2^{53} - 1\) )
- And down to **-9007199254740991** ( \(-2^{53} + 1\) )

Values outside this range lose precision.

## How to Create a BigInt
To create a BigInt, you can append `n` to the end of an integer or call `BigInt()`:

### Examples
```javascript
let x = 9999999999999999; // Normal
let y = 9999999999999999n; // BigInt
let z = BigInt(1234567890123456789012345); // BigInt
```

## BigInt: A New Data Type in JavaScript
The type of a BigInt is `"bigint"`:

### Example
```javascript
let x = BigInt(999999999999999);
let type = typeof x; // "bigint"
```

BigInt is the second numeric data type in JavaScript (after Number). With BigInt, the total number of supported data types in JavaScript is **8**:

1. String
2. Number
3. Bigint
4. Boolean
5. Undefined
6. Null
7. Symbol
8. Object

### Analogy
Imagine you have a store that sells different types of fruits. Each type of fruit represents a data type in JavaScript. BigInt is a new fruit that has been added to the store.

## BigInt Operators
Operators that can be used on a normal JavaScript Number can also be used on a BigInt.

### Example of BigInt Multiplication
```javascript
let x = 9007199254740995n;
let y = 9007199254740995n;
let z = x * y; // Multiplication
```

### Notes
- Arithmetic between a BigInt and a normal Number is not allowed (type conversion may lose information).
- The unsigned right shift (`>>>`) cannot be done on a BigInt (it does not have a fixed width).

## BigInt and Decimals
A BigInt cannot have decimals.

### Example of BigInt Division
```javascript
let x = 5n;
let y = x / 2; // Error: Cannot mix BigInt and other types
let z = Number(x) / 2; // Explicit conversion
```

## Hexadecimal, Octal, and Binary Notation for BigInt
A BigInt can also be written in hexadecimal, octal, or binary notation:

### Example in Hexadecimal
```javascript
let hex = 0x20000000000003n; // Hexadecimal
let oct = 0o400000000000000003n; // Octal
let bin = 0b100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011n; // Binary
```

## Curiosity about Precision
Rounding can compromise program security.

### Example of MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
```javascript
9007199254740992 === 9007199254740993; // is true !!!
```

## Browser Support
BigInt is supported in all browsers since September 2020:

- Chrome 67
- Edge 79
- Firefox 68
- Safari 14
- Opera 54

## Minimum and Maximum Safe Integers
ES6 added max and min properties to the Number object:

- **MAX_SAFE_INTEGER**
- **MIN_SAFE_INTEGER**

### Example of MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
```javascript
let x = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER; // 9007199254740991
```

### Example of MIN_SAFE_INTEGER
```javascript
let x = Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER; // -9007199254740991
```

## New Methods for the Number Object
ES6 also added 2 new methods to the Number object:

- **Number.isInteger()**
- **Number.isSafeInteger()**

### Number.isInteger() Method
The `Number.isInteger()` method returns `true` if the argument is an integer.

#### Example of isInteger()
```javascript
Number.isInteger(10); // true
Number.isInteger(10.5); // false
```

### Number.isSafeInteger() Method
A safe integer is an integer that can be exactly represented as a double-precision number.

The `Number.isSafeInteger()` method returns `true` if the argument is a safe integer.

#### Example of isSafeInteger()
```javascript
Number.isSafeInteger(10); // true
Number.isSafeInteger(12345678901234567890); // false
```

Safe integers are all integers from \(-(2^{53} - 1)\) to \((2^{53} - 1)\). This is safe: **9007199254740991**. This is not safe: **9007199254740992**.

# JavaScript Number Methods

Understanding JavaScript number methods is crucial for effective programming. Let's explore these methods, breaking them down using simple analogies to make the concepts more relatable.

## Overview of Number Methods

These number methods can be used on all JavaScript numbers:

| Method          | Description                                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `toString()`     | Returns a number as a string                      |
| `toExponential()`| Returns a number written in exponential notation   |
| `toFixed()`      | Returns a number written with a specified number of decimals |
| `toPrecision()`  | Returns a number written with a specified length  |
| `valueOf()`      | Returns a number as a number                      |

---

## The `toString()` Method

Imagine you have a number like a fruit (say, an apple). The `toString()` method takes that apple and puts it in a shiny gift box (the string). 

### Example:
```javascript
let x = 123;
console.log(x.toString());        // "123"
console.log((123).toString());     // "123"
console.log((100 + 23).toString()); // "123"
```

---

## The `toExponential()` Method

Think of this method as a way to express a number in a compact form, like using an abbreviation. If you have a long name, you might say ‚ÄúMr. Smith‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúMister Smith.‚Äù 

### Example:
```javascript
let x = 9.656;
console.log(x.toExponential(2));  // "9.66e+0"
console.log(x.toExponential(4));  // "9.6560e+0"
console.log(x.toExponential(6));  // "9.656000e+0"
```
The parameter is optional; if omitted, JavaScript will use the default representation.

---

## The `toFixed()` Method

This method is like setting your watch to show the exact time. `toFixed()` specifies how many decimal places you want to see, just like adjusting your watch to show seconds.

### Example:
```javascript
let x = 9.656;
console.log(x.toFixed(0));   // "10"
console.log(x.toFixed(2));   // "9.66"
console.log(x.toFixed(4));   // "9.6560"
console.log(x.toFixed(6));   // "9.656000"
```

---

## The `toPrecision()` Method

Think of `toPrecision()` as tailoring a suit to fit perfectly. You specify how you want the number to fit (the length), and it adjusts accordingly.

### Example:
```javascript
let x = 9.656;
console.log(x.toPrecision());  // "9.656"
console.log(x.toPrecision(2));  // "9.7"
console.log(x.toPrecision(4));  // "9.656"
console.log(x.toPrecision(6));  // "9.65600"
```

---

## The `valueOf()` Method

This method is straightforward, like showing the actual weight of an object instead of describing it. `valueOf()` gives you the raw number without any decoration.

### Example:
```javascript
let x = 123;
console.log(x.valueOf());        // 123
console.log((123).valueOf());     // 123
console.log((100 + 23).valueOf()); // 123
```
In JavaScript, a number can be either a primitive value (`typeof = number`) or an object (`typeof = object`). `valueOf()` is used internally to convert number objects to primitive values.

---

## Converting Variables to Numbers

There are three JavaScript methods that can be used to convert a variable to a number:

| Method         | Description                                        |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `Number()`      | Returns a number converted from its argument.     |
| `parseFloat()`  | Parses its argument and returns a floating point number. |
| `parseInt()`    | Parses its argument and returns a whole number.    |

### The `Number()` Method

Using `Number()` is like trying to measure an object with a ruler. You expect it to give you a numerical representation of whatever you give it.

### Example:
```javascript
console.log(Number(true));          // 1
console.log(Number(false));         // 0
console.log(Number("10"));          // 10
console.log(Number("  10"));        // 10
console.log(Number("10.33"));       // 10.33
console.log(Number("John"));        // NaN
```
If the value cannot be converted, it returns `NaN` (Not a Number).

---

### The `parseInt()` Method

`parseInt()` is like picking out the first whole piece of fruit from a mixed basket. It grabs the initial integer it sees.

### Example:
```javascript
console.log(parseInt("-10"));      // -10
console.log(parseInt("10.33"));     // 10
console.log(parseInt("10 years"));   // 10
console.log(parseInt("years 10"));   // NaN
```

---

### The `parseFloat()` Method

Similarly, `parseFloat()` is like looking for the first number in a series but allowing for decimals. 

### Example:
```javascript
console.log(parseFloat("10.33"));   // 10.33
console.log(parseFloat("10 years")); // 10
console.log(parseFloat("years 10")); // NaN
```

---

## Number Object Methods

These object methods belong to the `Number` object:

| Method                        | Description                                       |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `Number.isInteger()`          | Returns true if the argument is an integer       |
| `Number.isSafeInteger()`      | Returns true if the argument is a safe integer   |
| `Number.parseFloat()`         | Converts a string to a number                    |
| `Number.parseInt()`           | Converts a string to a whole number              |

### The `Number.isInteger()` Method

This method checks if a number is a whole number, similar to checking if an apple is whole and not cut in half.

### Example:
```javascript
console.log(Number.isInteger(10));     // true
console.log(Number.isInteger(10.5));   // false
```

---

### The `Number.isSafeInteger()` Method

A safe integer is like a reliable vehicle that can handle various terrains without breaking down. This method ensures the integer is safe to use.

### Example:
```javascript
console.log(Number.isSafeInteger(10));          // true
console.log(Number.isSafeInteger(12345678901234567890)); // false
```

Safe integers range from -(2^53 - 1) to +(2^53 - 1).

---

### The `Number.parseFloat()` and `Number.parseInt()` Methods

Both `Number.parseFloat()` and `Number.parseInt()` serve the same purpose as their global counterparts but offer a more modular approach to JavaScript.

### Example:
```javascript
console.log(Number.parseInt("10"));          // 10
console.log(Number.parseFloat("10.33"));     // 10.33
```

---

## Conclusion

By understanding these JavaScript number methods, you can manipulate numbers effectively in your programs. Use the analogies to help remember the methods and their functionalities, making your journey into frontend development smoother and more intuitive.

# JavaScript Number Properties

## Number Properties

| Property             | Description                                                |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `EPSILON`            | The difference between 1 and the smallest number > 1.     |
| `MAX_VALUE`          | The largest possible number in JavaScript.                 |
| `MIN_VALUE`          | The smallest possible number in JavaScript.                |
| `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`   | The maximum safe integer (253 - 1).                        |
| `MIN_SAFE_INTEGER`   | The minimum safe integer -(253 - 1).                       |
| `POSITIVE_INFINITY`  | Infinity (returned on overflow).                          |
| `NEGATIVE_INFINITY`  | Negative infinity (returned on overflow).                 |
| `NaN`                | A value that stands for "Not a Number".                   |

## JavaScript EPSILON

The `Number.EPSILON` property represents the difference between the smallest floating-point number greater than 1 and 1.

**Example**
```javascript
let x = Number.EPSILON;
console.log(x); // 2.220446049250313e-16
```

**Note**: `Number.EPSILON` is an ES6 feature and does not work in Internet Explorer.

**Analogy**: Think of `EPSILON` as a ruler measuring the tiniest gap you can perceive between two objects. Though it seems like a small space, it‚Äôs crucial for understanding the precision of numbers.

## JavaScript MAX_VALUE

`Number.MAX_VALUE` is a constant representing the largest possible number in JavaScript.

**Example**
```javascript
let x = Number.MAX_VALUE;
console.log(x); // 1.7976931348623157e+308
```

**Analogy**: Imagine `MAX_VALUE` as the peak of a mountain. As you climb, you get closer to the top, but there‚Äôs a point where you can‚Äôt go any further. That‚Äôs the largest number JavaScript can handle.

## JavaScript MIN_VALUE

`Number.MIN_VALUE` is a constant representing the smallest possible number in JavaScript.

**Example**
```javascript
let x = Number.MIN_VALUE;
console.log(x); // 5e-324
```

**Analogy**: Think of `MIN_VALUE` as the bottom of an ocean. It‚Äôs the lowest point you can reach in the water, but there‚Äôs still a bit of water left, even if it‚Äôs very little.

## JavaScript MAX_SAFE_INTEGER

`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` represents the maximum safe integer in JavaScript, which is (253 - 1).

**Example**
```javascript
let x = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
console.log(x); // 9007199254740991
```

**Analogy**: Consider `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` as a safe deposit box. You can store items up to a certain limit; beyond that, items might get damaged or lost.

## JavaScript MIN_SAFE_INTEGER

`Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` represents the minimum safe integer in JavaScript, which is -(253 - 1).

**Example**
```javascript
let x = Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER;
console.log(x); // -9007199254740991
```

**Note**: `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` and `MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` are ES6 features and do not work in Internet Explorer.

**Analogy**: Think of `MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` as the bottom of a safe deposit box. It‚Äôs the lowest point you can store items without losing them.

## JavaScript POSITIVE_INFINITY

`Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` represents positive infinity.

**Example**
```javascript
let x = Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
console.log(x); // Infinity
```

**Positive Infinity** is returned in case of an overflow:

```javascript
let x = 1 / 0; // Returns Infinity
console.log(x);
```

**Analogy**: Think of `POSITIVE_INFINITY` as the horizon. No matter how far you walk towards it, it always seems to be in the distance; you never reach it.

## JavaScript NEGATIVE_INFINITY

`Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` represents negative infinity.

**Example**
```javascript
let x = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
console.log(x); // -Infinity
```

**Negative Infinity** is returned in case of an overflow:

```javascript
let x = -1 / 0; // Returns -Infinity
console.log(x);
```

**Analogy**: Think of `NEGATIVE_INFINITY` as the bottom of a well. The deeper you dig, the further you get from the surface, but you never reach a bottom.

## JavaScript NaN - Not a Number

`NaN` is a reserved word in JavaScript that indicates a number that is not valid.

**Example**
```javascript
let x = Number.NaN;
console.log(x); // NaN
```

Attempting to perform an arithmetic operation with a non-numeric string will result in `NaN` (Not a Number):

```javascript
let x = 100 / "Apple"; // Returns NaN
console.log(x);
```

**Analogy**: Think of `NaN` as a puzzle with pieces that don‚Äôt fit together. No matter how hard you try, you can‚Äôt form a coherent picture with those pieces.

## Number Properties Cannot Be Used in Variables

Number properties belong to the Number object in JavaScript. These properties can only be accessed as `Number.MAX_VALUE`. 

Using `x.MAX_VALUE`, where `x` is a variable or value, will return `undefined`:

**Example**
```javascript
let x = 6;
console.log(x.MAX_VALUE); // undefined
```

**Analogy**: This is like trying to use a label that‚Äôs only on the box, not on the object inside the box. The object inside the box can‚Äôt access the properties of the box.

---

# JavaScript Arrays

## What is an Array?

An array is a special variable that can hold more than one value. Think of it as a box that can contain multiple items, making it easier to manage collections of data.

```javascript
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
```

### Why Use Arrays?

If you have a list of items (like car names), using single variables for each item can quickly become cumbersome. For example, consider this:

```javascript
let car1 = "Saab";
let car2 = "Volvo";
let car3 = "BMW";
```

But what if you want to find a specific car or if you had not 3 cars, but 300? The solution is an array! An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values using their index numbers.

### Creating an Array

The easiest way to create a JavaScript array is using an array literal.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const array_name = [item1, item2, ...];
```

It's common practice to declare arrays with the `const` keyword.

#### Example

```javascript
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
```

Spaces and line breaks are not important. A declaration can span multiple lines:

```javascript
const cars = [
  "Saab",
  "Volvo",
  "BMW"
];
```

You can also create an array and then provide the elements:

```javascript
const cars = [];
cars[0] = "Saab";
cars[1] = "Volvo";
cars[2] = "BMW";
```

### Using the JavaScript Keyword `new`

You can also create an array using the `new` keyword, but it‚Äôs not necessary. 

#### Example

```javascript
const cars = new Array("Saab", "Volvo", "BMW");
```

Both methods accomplish the same thing, but for simplicity and readability, it‚Äôs better to use the array literal method.

### Accessing Array Elements

To access an element in an array, refer to its index number. 

```javascript
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
let car = cars[0]; // Access the first element
```

**Note:** Array indexes start at 0. So, `[0]` is the first element, and `[1]` is the second.

### Changing an Array Element

You can change the value of an array element by accessing it via its index:

```javascript
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
cars[0] = "Opel"; // Changes the first element to "Opel"
```

### Converting an Array to a String

You can convert an array to a string using the `toString()` method:

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits.toString();
```

**Result:** `Banana,Orange,Apple,Mango`

### Access the Full Array

You can access the entire array by referring to its name:

```javascript
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars;
```

### Arrays are Objects

In JavaScript, arrays are a special type of objects. The `typeof` operator will return "object" for arrays.

```javascript
const person = ["John", "Doe", 46];
```

### Array Elements Can Be Objects

JavaScript allows arrays to hold variables of different types:

```javascript
myArray[0] = Date.now; // A function
myArray[1] = myFunction; // Another function
myArray[2] = myCars; // Another array
```

### Array Properties and Methods

JavaScript arrays come with built-in properties and methods that give them their power:

- `cars.length` // Returns the number of elements
- `cars.sort()` // Sorts the array

### The Length Property

The `length` property returns the number of elements in an array:

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let length = fruits.length; // length will be 4
```

**Note:** The length property is always one more than the highest index.

### Accessing the First and Last Array Element

To access the first and last elements:

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let firstFruit = fruits[0]; // First element
let lastFruit = fruits[fruits.length - 1]; // Last element
```

### Looping Through Array Elements

You can loop through an array using a `for` loop:

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let text = "<ul>";
for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
  text += "<li>" + fruits[i] + "</li>";
}
text += "</ul>";
```

Or you can use the `forEach()` function:

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let text = "<ul>";
fruits.forEach(function(value) {
  text += "<li>" + value + "</li>";
});
text += "</ul>";
```

### Adding Array Elements

The easiest way to add a new element to an array is with the `push()` method:

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];
fruits.push("Lemon"); // Adds "Lemon" to the end of the array
```

You can also use the `length` property to add elements:

```javascript
fruits[fruits.length] = "Lemon"; // Adds "Lemon" to the end
```

#### WARNING!

Adding elements with high indexes can create undefined "holes" in an array:

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];
fruits[6] = "Lemon"; // Creates undefined holes in the array
```

### Associative Arrays

Many programming languages support arrays with named indexes, called associative arrays or hashes. JavaScript does not support these. 

If you use named indexes in JavaScript, it will redefine the array as an object, which can lead to unexpected results:

```javascript
const person = [];
person["firstName"] = "John"; // Redefines person as an object
person.length; // Returns 0
```

### The Difference Between Arrays and Objects

- In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes, while objects use named indexes.
- Arrays are a special kind of object with numbered indexes.

### When to Use Arrays vs. Objects

- Use objects when you want the element names to be strings (text).
- Use arrays when you want the element names to be numbers.

### Recognizing an Array

To check if a variable is an array, you can use:

**Solution 1:**

```javascript
Array.isArray(fruits); // Returns true if fruits is an array
```

**Solution 2:**

```javascript
(fruits instanceof Array); // Returns true if fruits is an array
```

### Nested Arrays and Objects

Values in objects can be arrays, and values in arrays can be objects:

```javascript
const myObj = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  cars: [
    { name: "Ford", models: ["Fiesta", "Focus", "Mustang"] },
    { name: "BMW", models: ["320", "X3", "X5"] },
    { name: "Fiat", models: ["500", "Panda"] }
  ]
};
```

To access arrays within objects, use a loop:

```javascript
for (let i in myObj.cars) {
  console.log(myObj.cars[i].name);
  for (let j in myObj.cars[i].models) {
    console.log(myObj.cars[i].models[j]);
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Arrays are a fundamental part of JavaScript, providing a powerful way to manage collections of data. Understanding how to use them effectively will greatly enhance your ability to work with the language.

### Summary of Features:
- **Simple Analogies:** Each technical concept is explained with relatable analogies.
- **Code Examples:** Clear code snippets illustrate each point.
- **Warnings and Best Practices:** Important notes highlight potential pitfalls in using arrays.
- **Nested Structures:** Examples of nested arrays and objects provide a broader context.

# JavaScript Array Methods

## Basic Array Methods

### Array Length
**Concept**: The length property returns the size of an array.

**Analogy**: Imagine an array as a bookshelf. The `length` is like counting how many books are on that shelf.

**Example**:
```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let size = fruits.length; // size will be 4
```

### Array toString()
**Concept**: The `toString()` method converts an array to a string of comma-separated values.

**Analogy**: Think of `toString()` as a friendly librarian who gathers all the book titles and lists them on a single page.

**Example**:
```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
console.log(fruits.toString()); // Output: "Banana,Orange,Apple,Mango"
```

### Array at()
**Concept**: The `at()` method retrieves an element from an array using a specified index.

**Analogy**: If you have a box of chocolates, `at()` is like picking a specific chocolate by its position.

**Example**:
```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let fruit = fruits.at(2); // fruit will be "Apple"
```

### Array join()
**Concept**: The `join()` method joins all elements of an array into a string with a specified separator.

**Analogy**: It‚Äôs like stringing together beads, where you can choose what type of string to use (comma, asterisk, etc.).

**Example**:
```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
console.log(fruits.join(" * ")); // Output: "Banana * Orange * Apple * Mango"
```

### Popping and Pushing
**Concept**: Popping removes the last element from an array, while pushing adds a new element to the end.

**Analogy**: Picture a basket. You can remove the last apple (pop) or add a new apple to the basket (push).

**JavaScript Array pop()**:
```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.pop(); // Removes "Mango"
```

**JavaScript Array push()**:
```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.push("Kiwi"); // Adds "Kiwi"
```

### Shifting Elements
**Concept**: Shifting removes the first element from an array and shifts all other elements down one index.

**Analogy**: Think of a row of people. If the first person leaves, everyone else shifts forward to fill the gap.

**JavaScript Array shift()**:
```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.shift(); // Removes "Banana"
```

**JavaScript Array unshift()**:
```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.unshift("Lemon"); // Adds "Lemon" at the beginning
```

### Changing Elements
**Concept**: You can change an element by accessing it through its index.

**Analogy**: If you have a recipe book, changing an ingredient is like switching one entry in the index.

**Example**:
```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits[0] = "Kiwi"; // Replaces "Banana" with "Kiwi"
```

### Array delete()
**Warning**: Using `delete()` leaves undefined holes in the array. Use `pop()` or `shift()` instead.

**Analogy**: Deleting a book from the shelf without removing it leaves an empty space that nobody can use.

**Example**:
```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
delete fruits[0]; // Leaves an undefined hole
```

### Merging Arrays (Concatenating)
**Concept**: Concatenation means joining arrays end-to-end.

**Analogy**: Think of it as connecting two chains; the links from both chains come together to form one longer chain.

**JavaScript Array concat()**:
```javascript
const myGirls = ["Cecilie", "Lone"];
const myBoys = ["Emil", "Tobias", "Linus"];
const myChildren = myGirls.concat(myBoys); // Merges both arrays
```

### Array copyWithin()
**Concept**: The `copyWithin()` method copies elements to another position in the same array.

**Analogy**: It‚Äôs like rearranging books on a shelf without adding or removing any.

**Example**:
```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.copyWithin(2, 0); // Copies "Banana" and "Orange" to positions 2 and 3
```

### Flattening an Array
**Concept**: Flattening reduces the dimensionality of an array.

**Analogy**: Imagine a multi-layer cake. Flattening it is like squishing the cake down to a single layer.

**JavaScript Array flat()**:
```javascript
const myArr = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]];
const newArr = myArr.flat(); // Flattens to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### JavaScript Array splice()
**Concept**: The `splice()` method can add or remove items in an array.

**Analogy**: Think of it as editing a document; you can cut, add, or replace text.

**Example**:
```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.splice(2, 0, "Lemon", "Kiwi"); // Adds "Lemon" and "Kiwi" at index 2
```

### JavaScript Array slice()
**Concept**: The `slice()` method creates a new array by slicing out a part of an existing array.

**Analogy**: It‚Äôs like cutting a piece of cake; you take a slice but leave the rest intact.

**Example**:
```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Lemon", "Apple", "Mango"];
const citrus = fruits.slice(1, 3); // Returns ["Orange", "Lemon"]
```

## Automatic toString
**Concept**: JavaScript automatically converts an array to a comma-separated string when a primitive value is expected.

**Analogy**: Just like a magic trick, when you call an array in a console, it transforms into a neat list of items.

**Example**:
```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
console.log(fruits); // Automatically outputs: "Banana,Orange,Apple,Mango"
```

# JavaScript Array Search

In this section, we'll explore various methods to search through arrays in JavaScript. Think of an array as a line of people waiting to enter a concert, and we want to find specific individuals (or values) in that line. Each person has a position, just like each value in the array has an index.

## Array Find and Search Methods

### Array `indexOf()`

The `indexOf()` method is like asking for the position of a friend in line. If your friend "Apple" is at the second position, you would get `1` (remember, we start counting from 0).

**Example:**

```javascript
const fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let position = fruits.indexOf("Apple") + 1; // returns 1 (first occurrence)
```

**Syntax:**

```javascript
array.indexOf(item, start)
```

- `item`: The item you are searching for.
- `start`: Optional. The index at which to begin the search. Negative values will start counting from the end.

**Note:** If the item is not found, it returns `-1`. If it appears multiple times, only the position of the first occurrence is returned.

---

### Array `lastIndexOf()`

The `lastIndexOf()` method works like a reverse search, looking for the last occurrence of a friend in line. If there are several "Apple" friends, it tells you the position of the last one.

**Example:**

```javascript
const fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let position = fruits.lastIndexOf("Apple") + 1; // returns 3 (last occurrence)
```

**Syntax:**

```javascript
array.lastIndexOf(item, start)
```

- `item`: The item to search for.
- `start`: Optional. The index to start the search. Negative values will start counting from the end.

---

### Array `includes()`

Introduced in ECMAScript 2016, `includes()` checks if a friend is present in line without giving their position.

**Example:**

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
console.log(fruits.includes("Mango")); // true
```

**Syntax:**

```javascript
array.includes(search-item)
```

**Note:** This method can also check for `NaN` values, unlike `indexOf()`.

**Browser Support:** This method is supported in all modern browsers but not in Internet Explorer.

---

### JavaScript Array `find()`

The `find()` method is like searching for the first friend in line who is taller than 18. It returns the value of the first person that satisfies the condition.

**Example:**

```javascript
const numbers = [4, 9, 16, 25, 29];
let first = numbers.find(value => value > 18); // returns 25
```

**Browser Support:** This is an ES6 feature and is supported in all modern browsers since June 2017.

---

### JavaScript Array `findIndex()`

Similar to `find()`, the `findIndex()` method returns the position (index) of the first person in line that satisfies the condition.

**Example:**

```javascript
const numbers = [4, 9, 16, 25, 29];
let firstIndex = numbers.findIndex(value => value > 18); // returns 3
```

**Browser Support:** This method is also an ES6 feature and is supported in all modern browsers.

---

### JavaScript Array `findLast()`

Introduced in ES2023, `findLast()` starts from the end of the line and returns the value of the first person that satisfies the condition.

**Example:**

```javascript
const temp = [27, 28, 30, 40, 42, 35, 30];
let high = temp.findLast(x => x > 40); // returns 42
```

**Browser Support:** Supported in modern browsers since July 2023.

---

### JavaScript Array `findLastIndex()`

The `findLastIndex()` method finds the index of the last person in line who satisfies a condition.

**Example:**

```javascript
const temp = [27, 28, 30, 40, 42, 35, 30];
let lastIndex = temp.findLastIndex(x => x > 40); // returns 4
```

**Browser Support:** Supported in modern browsers since July 2023.

# JavaScript Sorting Arrays

## Array Sort Methods

### Alphabetic Sort

Imagine you're organizing a box of crayons by color. You take each crayon and place it in order from A to Z, just like sorting an array alphabetically. In JavaScript, you can use the `sort()` method to accomplish this.

**Example:**
```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.sort();
console.log(fruits); // ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango", "Orange"]
```

### Reversing an Array

Now, let‚Äôs say you want to put those crayons back in reverse order, from Z to A. You can achieve this using the `reverse()` method.

**Example:**
```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.reverse();
console.log(fruits); // ["Mango", "Apple", "Orange", "Banana"]
```

By combining `sort()` and `reverse()`, you can sort an array in descending order:

**Example:**
```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.sort().reverse();
console.log(fruits); // ["Orange", "Mango", "Banana", "Apple"]
```

### JavaScript Array toSorted() Method

Starting with ES2023, the `toSorted()` method was introduced to sort an array without changing the original array. It‚Äôs like making a photocopy of your crayon box before sorting it, so you still have the original.

**Example:**
```javascript
const months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"];
const sorted = months.toSorted();
console.log(sorted); // ["Apr", "Feb", "Jan", "Mar"]
console.log(months); // ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"] (original remains unchanged)
```

### JavaScript Array toReversed() Method

Similarly, ES2023 added the `toReversed()` method to reverse an array without altering the original. It‚Äôs like flipping the crayons upside down, but still keeping the original order intact.

**Example:**
```javascript
const months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"];
const reversed = months.toReversed();
console.log(reversed); // ["Apr", "Mar", "Feb", "Jan"]
console.log(months); // ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"] (original remains unchanged)
```

### Numeric Sort

When sorting numbers, you must be cautious. Just like sorting a pile of toy cars by size, you can't compare them as if they were strings. For instance, "25" comes before "100" if treated as strings because "2" is less than "1". 

To fix this, provide a compare function in the `sort()` method.

**Example:**
```javascript
const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
points.sort((a, b) => a - b);
console.log(points); // [1, 5, 10, 25, 40, 100]
```

### The Compare Function

The compare function defines an alternative sort order. It should return a negative, zero, or positive value based on its arguments:

- If the result is negative, `a` is sorted before `b`.
- If the result is positive, `b` is sorted before `a`.
- If the result is zero, the order remains unchanged.

**Example:**
```javascript
points.sort(function(a, b) {
  return a - b; // sorts numerically in ascending order
});
```

### Sorting an Array in Random Order

Sometimes, you want to shuffle your crayons randomly. You can use a sort function to accomplish this:

**Example:**
```javascript
const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
points.sort(() => 0.5 - Math.random());
console.log(points); // The order will be random
```

However, the above method is not completely accurate. The Fisher Yates shuffle is a more reliable way to achieve randomness:

**Example:**
```javascript
const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
for (let i = points.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
  const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
  [points[i], points[j]] = [points[j], points[i]]; // Swap elements
}
console.log(points); // Random order
```

### Find the Lowest (or Highest) Array Value

To find the min or max value in an array, you have several options:

1. Sort the array and check the first or last element.
2. Use `Math.min()` or `Math.max()`.
3. Write a homemade function.

**Using Math.min() on an Array:**

To find the lowest number in an array, use `Math.min.apply`:

**Example:**
```javascript
function myArrayMin(arr) {
  return Math.min.apply(null, arr);
}
console.log(myArrayMin([1, 2, 3])); // 1
```

**Using Math.max() on an Array:**

To find the highest number, use `Math.max.apply`:

**Example:**
```javascript
function myArrayMax(arr) {
  return Math.max.apply(null, arr);
}
console.log(myArrayMax([1, 2, 3])); // 3
```

### Homemade Min and Max Functions

You can create custom functions to find the minimum and maximum values:

**Find Min:**
```javascript
function myArrayMin(arr) {
  let min = Infinity;
  for (const num of arr) {
    if (num < min) {
      min = num;
    }
  }
  return min;
}
```

**Find Max:**
```javascript
function myArrayMax(arr) {
  let max = -Infinity;
  for (const num of arr) {
    if (num > max) {
      max = num;
    }
  }
  return max;
}
```

### Sorting Object Arrays

JavaScript arrays often contain objects, like a list of cars. You can sort these objects by their properties, much like organizing books by their titles.

**Example:**
```javascript
const cars = [
  {type:"Volvo", year:2016},
  {type:"Saab", year:2001},
  {type:"BMW", year:2010}
];

cars.sort((a, b) => a.year - b.year);
console.log(cars); // Sorted by year
```

### Stable Array Sort

Starting from ES2019, the `sort()` method ensures that elements with the same value maintain their relative position. 

**Example:**
```javascript
const myArr = [
  {name:"X00",price:100 },
  {name:"X01",price:100 },
  {name:"X02",price:100 },
  {name:"X03",price:100 },
  {name:"X04",price:110 },
  {name:"X05",price:110 },
  {name:"X06",price:110 },
  {name:"X07",price:110 }
];

myArr.sort((a, b) => a.price - b.price);
console.log(myArr); // X00, X01, X02, X03 will maintain their relative order
```

# JavaScript Array Iteration

## Array Iteration Methods

Array iteration methods operate on every array item:

- `Array forEach`
- `Array map()`
- `Array flatMap()`
- `Array filter()`
- `Array reduce()`
- `Array reduceRight()`

### See Also:
- Basic Array Methods
- Array Search Methods
- Array Sort Methods
- `Array every()`
- `Array some()`
- `Array from()`
- `Array keys()`
- `Array entries()`
- `Array with()`
- `Array Spread (...)`

---

## JavaScript Array forEach()

The `forEach()` method calls a function (a callback function) once for each array element. Think of it like a teacher (the `forEach` method) going through a list of students (the array) and giving each one a chance to answer a question.

### Example

```javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
let txt = "";
numbers.forEach(myFunction);

function myFunction(value, index, array) {
  txt += value + "<br>";
}
```

Note that the function takes 3 arguments:
- The item value
- The item index
- The array itself

The example above uses only the value parameter. The example can be rewritten to:

### Example

```javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
let txt = "";
numbers.forEach(myFunction);

function myFunction(value) {
  txt += value + "<br>";
}
```

---

## JavaScript Array map()

The `map()` method creates a new array by performing a function on each array element. Imagine a chef (the `map` method) who takes each ingredient (the array items), processes it, and creates a new dish (the new array).

### Example

```javascript
const numbers1 = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
const numbers2 = numbers1.map(myFunction);

function myFunction(value, index, array) {
  return value * 2;
}
```

This method does not change the original array.

When a callback function uses only the value parameter, the index and array parameters can be omitted:

### Example

```javascript
const numbers1 = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
const numbers2 = numbers1.map(myFunction);

function myFunction(value) {
  return value * 2;
}
```

---

## JavaScript Array flatMap()

ES2019 added the `flatMap()` method to JavaScript. This method first maps all elements of an array and then creates a new array by flattening the array, similar to a baker who layers cake batter and then flattens it out into a single layer for baking.

### Example

```javascript
const myArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const newArr = myArr.flatMap((x) => x * 2);
```

### Browser Support
`flatMap()` is supported in all modern browsers since January 2020:
- Chrome 69
- Edge 79
- Firefox 62
- Safari 12
- Opera 56

---

## JavaScript Array filter()

The `filter()` method creates a new array with array elements that pass a test. Think of it as a security guard who only allows certain guests into a party based on specific criteria.

### Example

```javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
const over18 = numbers.filter(myFunction);

function myFunction(value) {
  return value > 18;
}
```

---

## JavaScript Array reduce()

The `reduce()` method runs a function on each array element to produce (reduce it to) a single value, like an accountant who summarizes all expenses into a single report.

### Example

```javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
let sum = numbers.reduce(myFunction);

function myFunction(total, value) {
  return total + value;
}
```

The `reduce()` method can accept an initial value:

### Example

```javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
let sum = numbers.reduce(myFunction, 100);

function myFunction(total, value) {
  return total + value;
}
```

---

## JavaScript Array reduceRight()

The `reduceRight()` method is similar to `reduce()`, but it works from right-to-left in the array, like reading a book from the back cover to the front.

### Example

```javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
let sum = numbers.reduceRight(myFunction);

function myFunction(total, value) {
  return total + value;
}
```

---

## JavaScript Array every()

The `every()` method checks if all array values pass a test. It‚Äôs like a teacher checking if every student in the class has completed their homework.

### Example

```javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
let allOver18 = numbers.every(myFunction);

function myFunction(value) {
  return value > 18;
}
```

---

## JavaScript Array some()

The `some()` method checks if some array values pass a test. It‚Äôs like asking if at least one student has their homework done.

### Example

```javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
let someOver18 = numbers.some(myFunction);

function myFunction(value) {
  return value > 18;
}
```

---

## JavaScript Array.from()

The `Array.from()` method returns an Array object from any object with a length property or any iterable object, like transforming a string into an array of characters.

### Example

```javascript
Array.from("ABCDEFG");
```

### Browser Support
`from()` is an ES6 feature (JavaScript 2015) and is fully supported in all modern browsers since June 2017.

---

## JavaScript Array keys()

The `Array.keys()` method returns an Array Iterator object with the keys of an array. It‚Äôs like giving you the index cards that correspond to each item in a library.

### Example

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
const keys = fruits.keys();

for (let x of keys) {
  console.log(x);
}
```

### Browser Support
`keys()` is an ES6 feature (JavaScript 2015) and is supported in all modern browsers since June 2017.

---

## JavaScript Array entries()

The `entries()` method returns an Array Iterator object with key/value pairs, like a ledger that records transactions.

### Example

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
const f = fruits.entries();

for (let x of f) {
  console.log(x);
}
```

---

## JavaScript Array with() Method

ES2023 added the `Array.with()` method as a safe way to update elements in an array without altering the original array, similar to a librarian who can check out a book without damaging it.

### Example

```javascript
const months = ["January", "February", "March", "April"];
const myMonths = months.with(2, "March");
```

---

## JavaScript Array Spread (...)

The `...` operator expands an iterable (like an array) into more elements, similar to pouring out contents from a container.

### Example

```javascript
const q1 = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar"];
const q2 = ["Apr", "May", "Jun"];
const q3 = ["Jul", "Aug", "Sep"];
const q4 = ["Oct", "Nov", "Dec"];

const year = [...q1, ...q2, ...q3, ...q4];
```

### Browser Support
`...` is an ES6 feature (JavaScript 2015) and is supported in all modern browsers since June 2017.

---

# JavaScript Array Const

## ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)

In 2015, JavaScript introduced an important new keyword: `const`.

It has become a common practice to declare arrays using `const`:

### Example
```javascript
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
```

## Cannot Be Reassigned

An array declared with `const` cannot be reassigned:

### Example
```javascript
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "Audi"]; // ERROR
```

### Analogy
Think of `const` as a label on a box. If you label the box "Cars," you cannot change the label to "Autos" (reassign the variable). However, you can still change the items inside the box (modify the contents of the array).

## Arrays Are Not Constants

The keyword `const` can be a bit misleading. It does NOT define a constant array; it defines a constant reference to an array.

Because of this, we can still change the elements of a constant array.

### Elements Can Be Reassigned
You can change the elements of a constant array:

### Example
```javascript
// You can create a constant array:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

// You can change an element:
cars[0] = "Toyota"; // Changes "Saab" to "Toyota"

// You can add an element:
cars.push("Audi"); // Adds "Audi"
```

### Analogy
Imagine that the labeled box "Cars" contains several car models. You can swap "Saab" for "Toyota" or add a new car "Audi" to the collection, but the box will always bear the label "Cars."

## Browser Support

The `const` keyword is not supported in Internet Explorer 10 or earlier.

The following table defines the first browser versions with full support for the `const` keyword:

| Browser    | Version       |
|------------|---------------|
| Chrome     | 49            |
| IE         | 11 / Edge     |
| Firefox    | 36            |
| Safari     | 10            |
| Opera      | 36            |
| Date       | Mar, 2016     |

## Assigned When Declared

JavaScript `const` variables must be assigned a value when they are declared.

Meaning: An array declared with `const` must be initialized when it is declared.

### Example
This will not work:
```javascript
const cars; // ERROR
cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
```

Arrays declared with `var` can be initialized at any time.

### Example
This is OK:
```javascript
cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]; // OK
var cars;
```

### Analogy
Think of `const` like an order at a restaurant. If you order a dish (declare the array), you must specify what you want (assign a value) when placing the order. If you just place the order without specifying, the waiter (the compiler) won‚Äôt know what to bring.

## Const Block Scope

An array declared with `const` has **block scope**.

An array declared in a block is not the same as an array declared outside the block:

### Example
```javascript
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
// Here cars[0] is "Saab"
{
  const cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "BMW"];
  // Here cars[0] is "Toyota"
}
// Here cars[0] is "Saab"
```

An array declared with `var` does not have block scope:

### Example
```javascript
var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
// Here cars[0] is "Saab"
{
  var cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "BMW"];
  // Here cars[0] is "Toyota"
}
// Here cars[0] is "Toyota"
```

### Analogy
Imagine you have two rooms (blocks) in a house. In each room, you can have a box labeled "Cars," but each room can contain different models of cars without interfering with each other.

## Redeclaring Arrays

Redeclaring an array declared with `var` is allowed anywhere in a program:

### Example
```javascript
var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
var cars = ["Toyota", "BMW"];  // Allowed
cars = ["Volvo", "Saab"];      // Allowed
```

Redeclaring or reassigning an array to `const`, in the same scope or in the same block, is not allowed:

### Example
```javascript
var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];     // Allowed
const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Not allowed
{
  var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Not allowed
}
```

Redeclaring or reassigning an existing `const` array, in the same scope or in the same block, is not allowed:

### Example
```javascript
const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Not allowed
var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];     // Not allowed
cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];         // Not allowed

{
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Allowed
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Not allowed
  var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Not allowed
  cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];       // Not allowed
}
```

Redeclaring an array with `const`, in another scope, or in another block, is allowed:

### Example
```javascript
const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
{
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Allowed
}
{
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Allowed
}
```

## Conclusion

The `const` keyword is a powerful tool in JavaScript, especially when working with arrays. By understanding how constant arrays work and their limitations, you can write cleaner, more effective code. Keep exploring and learning!

# JavaScript Date Objects

JavaScript Date Objects allow us to work with dates. When you create a new date, it might look like this:

```
Tue Oct 08 2024 15:01:51 GMT-0300 (Argentina Standard Time)
```

## Examples

```javascript
const d1 = new Date(); // Current date and time
const d2 = new Date("2022-03-25"); // Specific date
```

### Note
Date objects are **static**. The "clock" is not "running." The computer clock keeps ticking, but date objects do not update automatically.

## JavaScript Date Output

By default, JavaScript will use the browser's time zone and display a date as a full text string, like this:

```
Tue Oct 08 2024 15:01:51 GMT-0300 (Argentina Standard Time)
```

Later in this tutorial, you will learn more about how to display dates.

## Creating Date Objects

Date objects are created using the `new Date()` constructor. There are several ways to create a new date object:

### Different Ways to Create Date Objects
1. `new Date()`
2. `new Date(date string)`
3. `new Date(year, month)`
4. `new Date(year, month, day)`
5. `new Date(year, month, day, hours)`
6. `new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes)`
7. `new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds)`
8. `new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, ms)`
9. `new Date(milliseconds)`

### Using `new Date()`
`new Date()` creates a date object with the current date and time.

#### Example
```javascript
const d = new Date();
```

### Using `new Date(date string)`
`new Date(date string)` creates a date object from a date string.

#### Examples
```javascript
const d1 = new Date("October 13, 2014 11:13:00");
const d2 = new Date("2022-03-25");
```

### Note on Date Strings
Date string formats will be discussed in the next chapter.

### Using `new Date(year, month, ...)`
You can create a date object with a specified date and time by providing year, month, day, and so on.

#### Example
```javascript
const d = new Date(2018, 11, 24, 10, 33, 30, 0);
```

### Important Note
JavaScript counts months from 0 to 11, meaning January is 0 and December is 11. 

#### Example
```javascript
const d = new Date(2018, 15, 24, 10, 33, 30); // This is treated as March 24, 2019
```

### Overflowing Dates
If you specify a day higher than the maximum for that month, JavaScript will not throw an error; it will simply adjust the date:

```javascript
const d = new Date(2018, 5, 35, 10, 33, 30); // Treated as July 5, 2018
```

### Using 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 Numbers
- **6 numbers**: year, month, day, hour, minute, second
    ```javascript
    const d = new Date(2018, 11, 24, 10, 33, 30);
    ```

- **5 numbers**: year, month, day, hour, minute
    ```javascript
    const d = new Date(2018, 11, 24, 10, 33);
    ```

- **4 numbers**: year, month, day, hour
    ```javascript
    const d = new Date(2018, 11, 24, 10);
    ```

- **3 numbers**: year, month, day
    ```javascript
    const d = new Date(2018, 11, 24);
    ```

- **2 numbers**: year, month
    ```javascript
    const d = new Date(2018, 11);
    ```

- **1 number**: If you supply only one parameter, it will be treated as milliseconds.
    ```javascript
    const d = new Date(2018); // January 1, 2018
    ```

### Previous Century
One and two-digit years will be interpreted as 19xx:

#### Example
```javascript
const d1 = new Date(99, 11, 24); // December 24, 1999
const d2 = new Date(9, 11, 24); // December 24, 2009
```

## JavaScript Stores Dates as Milliseconds

JavaScript stores dates as the number of milliseconds since January 01, 1970.

- Zero time is: **January 01, 1970 00:00:00 UTC**.
- One day (24 hours) equals **86,400,000 milliseconds**.

Now, the current time might be represented as `1728410511980` milliseconds past January 01, 1970.

### Using `new Date(milliseconds)`
`new Date(milliseconds)` creates a new date object based on milliseconds since January 01, 1970.

#### Examples
- **Plus 100,000,000,000 milliseconds**:
    ```javascript
    const d = new Date(100000000000); // This will be some date in the future
    ```

- **Minus 100,000,000,000 milliseconds**:
    ```javascript
    const d = new Date(-100000000000); // This will be some date in the past
    ```

- **Plus 24 hours**:
    ```javascript
    const d = new Date(24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // This will be January 2, 1970
    ```

- **Plus 0 milliseconds**:
    ```javascript
    const d = new Date(0); // This will be January 01, 1970
    ```

## Date Methods

Once a date object is created, several methods allow you to manipulate it. These methods enable you to get and set the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond of date objects, using either local time or UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).

### Example of Date Methods
You will learn more about date methods and time zones in the upcoming chapters.

## Displaying Dates

JavaScript will output dates using the `toString()` method by default. This is a string representation of the date, including the time zone. The format is specified in the ECMAScript specification:

### Example
```javascript
// Output might look like:
Tue Oct 08 2024 15:01:51 GMT-0300 (Argentina Standard Time)
```

When you display a date object in HTML, it is automatically converted to a string using the `toString()` method:

```javascript
const d = new Date();
d.toString();
```

### Other Methods for Displaying Dates
- The `toDateString()` method converts a date to a more readable format:
    ```javascript
    const d = new Date();
    d.toDateString();
    ```

- The `toUTCString()` method converts a date to a string using the UTC standard:
    ```javascript
    const d = new Date();
    d.toUTCString();
    ```

- The `toISOString()` method converts a date to a string using the ISO standard:
    ```javascript
    const d = new Date();
    d.toISOString();
    ```

## Conclusion

Understanding JavaScript Date Objects is essential for managing and displaying dates in your applications. As you progress through this roadmap, you'll learn more about manipulating dates effectively.

# JavaScript Date Formats

When working with dates in JavaScript, it‚Äôs essential to understand how they are represented and handled. Imagine dates as time labels on a production line: they need to be precise and easy to interpret. Below, we will explore the different input and output formats for dates in JavaScript.

## JavaScript Date Input

There are generally three types of JavaScript date input formats:

| Type         | Example               |
|--------------|----------------------|
| ISO Date     | "2015-03-25"         |
| Short Date   | "03/25/2015"         |
| Long Date    | "Mar 25 2015" or "25 Mar 2015" |

### ISO Format

The ISO format follows a strict standard in JavaScript, much like a manual that everyone should follow. It is the recommended format and is presented as `YYYY-MM-DD` (Year-Month-Day). For example:

```javascript
const d = new Date("2015-03-25");
```

### Short Dates

Short dates typically have the format "MM/DD/YYYY". This format might be more familiar to those used to writing dates this way:

```javascript
const d = new Date("03/25/2015");
```

### Long Dates

Long dates are usually written in the "MMM DD YYYY" format, where "MMM" represents the month in abbreviated form (e.g., "Mar" for March):

```javascript
const d = new Date("Mar 25 2015");
```

## JavaScript Date Output

Regardless of the input format, JavaScript will, by default, display dates in a full text string format:

```
Tue Oct 08 2024 15:02:46 GMT-0300 (Argentina Standard Time)
```

### JavaScript ISO Dates

ISO 8601 is the international standard for the representation of dates and times. Using this format ensures that your dates are interpreted consistently.

#### Example (Complete Date)

```javascript
const d = new Date("2015-03-25");
```

Keep in mind that the computed date will be relative to your time zone. Depending on your location, the result could vary between March 24 and March 25.

#### ISO Dates (Year and Month)

You can write ISO dates without specifying the day:

```javascript
const d = new Date("2015-03");
```

In this case, the result could vary between February 28 and March 01, depending on the time zone.

#### ISO Dates (Only Year)

It‚Äôs also possible to write ISO dates with just the year:

```javascript
const d = new Date("2015");
```

This could result in dates ranging between December 31, 2014, and January 01, 2015.

#### ISO Dates (Date-Time)

ISO dates can include hours, minutes, and seconds:

```javascript
const d = new Date("2015-03-25T12:00:00Z");
```

In this format, "T" separates the date and time, and "Z" indicates that it is in UTC time.

If you want to adjust the time relative to UTC, you can remove the "Z" and add `+HH:MM` or `-HH:MM`:

```javascript
const d = new Date("2015-03-25T12:00:00-06:30");
```

### Time Zones

When setting a date without specifying the time zone, JavaScript will use the browser's time zone. For example, if a user browses from Central US, a date/time created in GMT will be converted to CDT.

## JavaScript Short Dates

Short dates are written using the "MM/DD/YYYY" syntax:

```javascript
const d = new Date("03/25/2015");
```

**Warnings:**
- In some browsers, months or days without leading zeros may cause errors:

```javascript
const d = new Date("2015-3-25"); // May fail
```

- The behavior of "YYYY/MM/DD" is undefined, and some browsers may guess the format or return NaN:

```javascript
const d = new Date("2015/03/25"); // Undefined
```

- The behavior of "DD-MM-YYYY" is also undefined:

```javascript
const d = new Date("25-03-2015"); // Undefined
```

## JavaScript Long Dates

Long dates are often written in the "MMM DD YYYY" format:

```javascript
const d = new Date("Mar 25 2015");
```

The month and day can be in any order:

```javascript
const d = new Date("25 Mar 2015");
```

The month can be written in full (January) or abbreviated (Jan):

```javascript
const d = new Date("January 25 2015");
const d = new Date("Jan 25 2015");
```

Commas are ignored, and names are case insensitive:

```javascript
const d = new Date("JANUARY, 25, 2015");
```

## Date Input - Parsing Dates

If you have a valid date string, you can use the `Date.parse()` method to convert it to milliseconds. This is like using a stopwatch that counts from a specific moment (January 1, 1970).

```javascript
let msec = Date.parse("March 21, 2012");
```

Then, you can use the number of milliseconds to convert it to a date object:

```javascript
const d = new Date(msec);
```

## Conclusion

Understanding date formats in JavaScript is essential for effectively working with temporal data. The analogies and technical concepts presented here are valuable tools on your path to becoming a frontend expert.

# JavaScript Get Date Methods

## The new Date() Constructor

In JavaScript, date objects are created with the `new Date()` constructor, similar to opening a diary to jot down the current date and time. When you use `new Date()`, it returns a date object reflecting the current date and time, just like writing today‚Äôs date in your diary.

### Get the Current Time

```javascript
const date = new Date();
```

This simple line retrieves the current date and time.

## Date Get Methods

JavaScript provides several methods to extract specific information from date objects. Think of these methods as tools in a toolbox, each designed to retrieve a particular piece of information about the date:

| Method             | Description                                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `getFullYear()`    | Get year as a four-digit number (yyyy)           |
| `getMonth()`       | Get month as a number (0-11)                     |
| `getDate()`        | Get day as a number (1-31)                       |
| `getDay()`         | Get weekday as a number (0-6)                    |
| `getHours()`       | Get hour (0-23)                                   |
| `getMinutes()`     | Get minute (0-59)                                 |
| `getSeconds()`     | Get second (0-59)                                 |
| `getMilliseconds()` | Get millisecond (0-999)                           |
| `getTime()`        | Get time in milliseconds since January 1, 1970   |

### Note 1

The get methods above return local time, like reading the time on your watch set to your local timezone. Universal time (UTC) is documented at the bottom of this page.

### Note 2

These get methods return information from existing date objects. In a date object, the time is static, like a photograph capturing a single moment. The "clock" is not "running," and the time in a date object is NOT the same as the current time.

## The getFullYear() Method

The `getFullYear()` method returns the year of a date as a four-digit number:

```javascript
const d = new Date("2021-03-25");
console.log(d.getFullYear()); // 2021

const d = new Date();
console.log(d.getFullYear()); // Current year
```

### Warning!

Old JavaScript code might use the non-standard method `getYear()`, which is supposed to return a two-digit year. However, `getYear()` is deprecated, meaning you should avoid using it‚Äîlike using outdated technology that could break anytime.

## The getMonth() Method

The `getMonth()` method returns the month of a date as a number (0-11). Here‚Äôs where things get interesting! In JavaScript, January is month number 0, February is 1, and so on, until December, which is 11. 

```javascript
const d = new Date("2021-03-25");
console.log(d.getMonth()); // 2 (March)

const d = new Date();
console.log(d.getMonth()); // Current month
```

### Note

To get the month name, you can use an array of month names:

```javascript
const months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
const d = new Date("2021-03-25");
let monthName = months[d.getMonth()];
console.log(monthName); // March
```

## The getDate() Method

The `getDate()` method returns the day of a date as a number (1-31):

```javascript
const d = new Date("2021-03-25");
console.log(d.getDate()); // 25

const d = new Date();
console.log(d.getDate()); // Current day
```

## The getHours() Method

The `getHours()` method returns the hours of a date as a number (0-23):

```javascript
const d = new Date("2021-03-25");
console.log(d.getHours()); // 0 (midnight)

const d = new Date();
console.log(d.getHours()); // Current hour
```

## The getMinutes() Method

The `getMinutes()` method returns the minutes of a date as a number (0-59):

```javascript
const d = new Date("2021-03-25");
console.log(d.getMinutes()); // 0

const d = new Date();
console.log(d.getMinutes()); // Current minute
```

## The getSeconds() Method

The `getSeconds()` method returns the seconds of a date as a number (0-59):

```javascript
const d = new Date("2021-03-25");
console.log(d.getSeconds()); // 0

const d = new Date();
console.log(d.getSeconds()); // Current second
```

## The getMilliseconds() Method

The `getMilliseconds()` method returns the milliseconds of a date as a number (0-999):

```javascript
const d = new Date("2021-03-25");
console.log(d.getMilliseconds()); // 0

const d = new Date();
console.log(d.getMilliseconds()); // Current milliseconds
```

## The getDay() Method

The `getDay()` method returns the weekday of a date as a number (0-6). In JavaScript, the first day of the week (day 0) is Sunday. Some countries consider Monday as the first day of the week.

```javascript
const d = new Date("2021-03-25");
console.log(d.getDay()); // 4 (Thursday)

const d = new Date();
console.log(d.getDay()); // Current weekday
```

### Note

You can use an array of names to return the weekday as a name:

```javascript
const days = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];
const d = new Date("2021-03-25");
let dayName = days[d.getDay()];
console.log(dayName); // Thursday
```

## The getTime() Method

The `getTime()` method returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970:

```javascript
const d = new Date("1970-01-01");
console.log(d.getTime()); // 0

const d = new Date("2021-03-25");
console.log(d.getTime()); // Milliseconds since 1970
```

## The Date.now() Method

`Date.now()` returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, much like a timer running since a specific point in time:

```javascript
let ms = Date.now();
console.log(ms); // Current milliseconds since 1970
```

You can also calculate the number of years since January 1, 1970:

```javascript
const minute = 1000 * 60;
const hour = minute * 60;
const day = hour * 24;
const year = day * 365;

let years = Math.round(Date.now() / year);
console.log(years); // Years since 1970
```

### Note

`Date.now()` is a static method of the Date object. You cannot use it on a date object like `myDate.now()`. The syntax is always `Date.now()`.

## UTC Date Get Methods

JavaScript also provides UTC date methods, which use UTC time (Coordinated Universal Time). UTC time is the same as GMT (Greenwich Mean Time), but the difference between local time and UTC time can be up to 24 hours.

| Method                   | Same As              | Description                     |
|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| `getUTCDate()`           | `getDate()`          | Returns the UTC date            |
| `getUTCFullYear()`       | `getFullYear()`      | Returns the UTC year            |
| `getUTCMonth()`          | `getMonth()`         | Returns the UTC month           |
| `getUTCDay()`            | `getDay()`           | Returns the UTC day             |
| `getUTCHours()`          | `getHours()`         | Returns the UTC hour            |
| `getUTCMinutes()`        | `getMinutes()`       | Returns the UTC minutes         |
| `getUTCSeconds()`        | `getSeconds()`       | Returns the UTC seconds         |
| `getUTCMilliseconds()`    | `getMilliseconds()`   | Returns the UTC milliseconds     |

## The getTimezoneOffset() Method

The `getTimezoneOffset()` method returns the difference (in minutes) between local time and UTC time:

```javascript
let diff = d.getTimezoneOffset();
console.log(diff); // Difference in minutes
```

---

# JavaScript Set Date Methods

In JavaScript, you can use several methods to set specific parts of a date, such as the year, month, day, hour, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. These methods allow you to modify a date according to your needs.

## Set Date Methods
The "set" methods in JavaScript allow you to change specific parts of a date object:

| Method               | Description                                                |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `setDate()`          | Set the day of the month (1-31)                             |
| `setFullYear()`      | Set the year (optionally month and day)                     |
| `setHours()`         | Set the hour (0-23)                                         |
| `setMilliseconds()`  | Set the milliseconds (0-999)                                |
| `setMinutes()`       | Set the minutes (0-59)                                      |
| `setMonth()`         | Set the month (0-11)                                        |
| `setSeconds()`       | Set the seconds (0-59)                                      |
| `setTime()`          | Set the time in milliseconds since January 1, 1970          |

### **Analogy:**
Imagine you have a paper calendar and you want to change any detail of an appointment you already wrote down‚Äîlike the day, hour, month, or even the year. JavaScript's "set" methods do the same thing, allowing you to modify specific parts of an existing date.

## The `setFullYear()` Method
The `setFullYear()` method sets the year of a date object.

### Example:
```javascript
const d = new Date();
d.setFullYear(2020);
```

This code changes the year of the current date to 2020.

### **Analogy:**
It‚Äôs like grabbing a page from your calendar and, instead of scratching out the entire date, you just change the year while leaving the rest as it is. In this case, you're changing the year to 2020, but the month and day remain the same.

This method can also optionally set the month and day:

### Example:
```javascript
const d = new Date();
d.setFullYear(2020, 11, 3);  // Year 2020, December 3
```

### **Extended Analogy:**
Now, not only do you change the year, but you also decide to move the date to a specific month (in this case, December, since months start at 0) and a specific day (the 3rd). It's like adjusting multiple details of your appointment on the calendar, not just the year.

## The `setMonth()` Method
The `setMonth()` method sets the month of a date object.

### Example:
```javascript
const d = new Date();
d.setMonth(11);  // December, because months start at 0
```

### **Analogy:**
Think of this as flipping through your calendar and changing the month of your appointment. You swap from the November page to the December page. Remember that in JavaScript, months start at 0, so 0 is January and 11 is December.

## The `setDate()` Method
The `setDate()` method sets the day of the month.

### Example:
```javascript
const d = new Date();
d.setDate(15);  // Sets the date to the 15th of the current month
```

### **Analogy:**
Imagine you already have an appointment on your calendar, but you want to move it to another day within the same month. You simply erase the old day and write down the new one, for example, moving it from the 1st to the 15th.

You can also use this method to **add days to a date**:

### Example:
```javascript
const d = new Date();
d.setDate(d.getDate() + 50);  // Adds 50 days to the current date
```

### **Analogy:**
Instead of picking an exact day, you decide to move your appointment forward by 50 days. If this shift takes the date into a different month or year, JavaScript automatically adjusts it, just like flipping forward through your calendar.

## The `setHours()` Method
The `setHours()` method sets the hours of a date object.

### Example:
```javascript
const d = new Date();
d.setHours(22);  // Sets the time to 10 PM
```

### **Analogy:**
This is like changing the time of a meeting in your schedule. You move it from the morning to the evening and write down 10 PM.

## The `setMinutes()` Method
The `setMinutes()` method sets the minutes of a date object.

### Example:
```javascript
const d = new Date();
d.setMinutes(30);  // Sets the minutes to 30
```

### **Analogy:**
It‚Äôs like fine-tuning the time of your appointment. For example, instead of having it at exactly 10:00, you change it to 10:30.

## The `setSeconds()` Method
The `setSeconds()` method sets the seconds of a date object.

### Example:
```javascript
const d = new Date();
d.setSeconds(30);  // Sets the seconds to 30
```

### **Analogy:**
If you were extremely precise with your scheduling, you could even adjust the exact seconds of an event. In this case, you decide that something will happen 30 seconds into the minute.

## Comparing Dates
You can easily compare dates in JavaScript to see which one comes before or after the other.

### Example:
```javascript
let text = "";
const today = new Date();
const someday = new Date();
someday.setFullYear(2100, 0, 14);  // Sets the date to January 14, 2100

if (someday > today) {
  text = "Today is before January 14, 2100.";
} else {
  text = "Today is after January 14, 2100.";
}
```

This code compares today's date to January 14, 2100, and tells you if today is before or after that date.

### **Analogy:**
Imagine you have two appointments on your calendar and you want to know which one comes first. You simply compare the two dates and decide which one is earlier. JavaScript lets you do the same thing by comparing two date objects to see which is "earlier" or "later."

## Note on JavaScript Months
Remember that JavaScript counts months from 0 to 11: January is 0, and December is 11. This is important to keep in mind when working with dates.

### **Analogy:**
It‚Äôs like having a row of numbered lockers where the first locker is labeled 0, not 1. So, if you‚Äôre looking for "January," instead of going to locker 1, you need to look in locker 0.

# JavaScript Math Object

## Understanding the Math Object with a Simple Analogy

Imagine you're a construction worker, and in your toolbox, you have a special tool that helps you do all kinds of mathematical tasks: this tool is the **Math Object** in JavaScript. It's like having a calculator built into your toolbox that you can use at any time without needing to assemble it. This calculator is always there, ready to help you with calculations, constants, and mathematical functions.

### Key Concepts:
- **Static Tool**: The Math object doesn't need to be created, like how a hammer is ready to use without needing to build it first. Just grab it when you need it!
- **Mathematical Constants**: Imagine constants as fixed numbers that never change, like the height of a building that‚Äôs already built. JavaScript provides 8 such constants in Math.

### Example: 
```js
Math.PI; // returns the value of Pi (3.14159...)
```

## Math Properties (Constants)

The **Math object** gives you access to some important numbers, which you can think of as "pre-measured" tools in your toolbox.

### JavaScript provides 8 mathematical constants:
- **Math.E**: Euler‚Äôs number, the base of natural logarithms (‚âà 2.718)
- **Math.PI**: The value of Pi (‚âà 3.14159)
- **Math.SQRT2**: The square root of 2 (‚âà 1.414)
- **Math.SQRT1_2**: The square root of 1/2 (‚âà 0.707)
- **Math.LN2**: The natural logarithm of 2 (‚âà 0.693)
- **Math.LN10**: The natural logarithm of 10 (‚âà 2.302)
- **Math.LOG2E**: The logarithm of E base 2 (‚âà 1.442)
- **Math.LOG10E**: The logarithm of E base 10 (‚âà 0.434)

These constants are like pre-programmed settings on your calculator; you don't need to calculate them yourself.

### Example:
```js
console.log(Math.PI);  // Outputs 3.14159...
```

## Math Methods: Working with Numbers

Think of **Math methods** as the different functions or modes on your calculator that perform tasks like rounding, finding square roots, and more. Let‚Äôs explore the common ones with a practical analogy.

### Number to Integer Methods: The Rounding Crew

Imagine you‚Äôre building a fence and need to decide how many full planks of wood to cut from a longer piece. You can either round to the nearest full plank, round up, or round down. These are similar to rounding numbers in JavaScript.

1. **Math.round(x)**: Rounds to the nearest integer. It‚Äôs like deciding whether to cut the wood slightly shorter or longer based on which is closest to your target.
   ```js
   Math.round(4.6); // returns 5
   Math.round(4.4); // returns 4
   ```

2. **Math.ceil(x)**: Rounds up to the nearest whole number. Think of this as always cutting the wood a bit longer just to be safe.
   ```js
   Math.ceil(4.2);  // returns 5
   ```

3. **Math.floor(x)**: Rounds down to the nearest whole number. This is like cutting the plank a bit shorter to avoid any excess.
   ```js
   Math.floor(4.9);  // returns 4
   ```

4. **Math.trunc(x)**: Removes the decimal part, leaving just the integer. It‚Äôs like cutting off the decimal portion completely without rounding.
   ```js
   Math.trunc(4.7);  // returns 4
   ```

### Math.sign(x): Checking the Sign of a Number

Imagine you're setting up a level to see if something is tilted. Is it leaning to the left (-1), balanced perfectly (0), or tilted to the right (1)? **Math.sign(x)** helps determine whether a number is negative, zero, or positive.

```js
Math.sign(-4);  // returns -1 (negative)
Math.sign(0);   // returns 0 (neutral)
Math.sign(5);   // returns 1 (positive)
```

### Math.pow(x, y): Raising Numbers to Power

If you want to multiply a number by itself several times, you use **Math.pow(x, y)**. This method is like saying, "I want to stack this block **x** times to make a tower with **y** blocks."

```js
Math.pow(2, 3); // returns 8 (2 cubed)
```

### Math.sqrt(x): Finding the Square Root

Taking the square root is like asking, "If I have a square, what would the length of one side be if the total area is **x**?" **Math.sqrt(x)** answers that.

```js
Math.sqrt(64);  // returns 8
```

### Math.random(): Rolling the Dice

Whenever you want to generate a random number (like rolling a dice), **Math.random()** returns a number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). Imagine shaking a box of marbles and pulling one out randomly.

```js
Math.random(); // returns a random number between 0 and 1
```

## More Useful Math Methods

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of other useful methods in the **Math Object**:

- **Math.abs(x)**: Returns the absolute value (always positive).
   ```js
   Math.abs(-4.7); // returns 4.7
   ```

- **Math.min() / Math.max()**: Find the lowest and highest value from a list.
   ```js
   Math.min(1, -3, 5); // returns -3
   Math.max(1, -3, 5); // returns 5
   ```

- **Math.sin(x) / Math.cos(x)**: Returns the sine or cosine of an angle (in radians).
   ```js
   Math.sin(Math.PI / 2); // returns 1 (sine of 90 degrees)
   ```

- **Math.log(x)**: Returns the natural logarithm of **x**, which tells you how much something has grown over time.
   ```js
   Math.log(1);  // returns 0
   ```

### Summary:

The **Math Object** in JavaScript is like your multi-purpose toolbox for handling numbers. Whether you‚Äôre rounding, calculating roots, or finding maximum values, these methods allow you to perform mathematical operations efficiently. And just like a trusty toolbox, you can use these functions anywhere in your code, without needing to create an object first.

# JavaScript: Generating Random Numbers

## What is `Math.random()`?

Imagine you have a box filled with numbered balls between 0 and 1. Every time you reach into the box, you pull out a random number. That number will always be greater than or equal to 0 but less than 1 (meaning you will **never get exactly 1**). In JavaScript, this "box" is the **`Math.random()`** function.

### Example:

```javascript
// Returns a random number between 0 and 1 (excluding 1)
Math.random();
```

### Technical Concept:
- **`Math.random()`** generates a floating-point number (a decimal) in the range [0, 1), meaning from 0 (inclusive) to 1 (exclusive).
- Each time you call **`Math.random()`**, you get a different value within that range.

## Random Integers

Although **`Math.random()`** gives you a decimal number, we often need **whole numbers** (integers) in programming. For example, if you want to simulate rolling a die, you only need whole numbers between 1 and 6.

To turn that decimal number into an integer, we combine **`Math.random()`** with **`Math.floor()`**.

### Analogy:
Think of **`Math.floor()`** as a pair of scissors that cuts off the decimal part. If you have the number 4.7, **`Math.floor()`** turns it into 4, removing the decimal without rounding.

### Example: Random integers from 0 to 9

```javascript
// Returns a random integer between 0 and 9
Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
```

Here, we multiply the random number (which is between 0 and 1) by 10 to shift the range to [0, 10). Then, **`Math.floor()`** removes the decimals, giving us a number between 0 and 9.

### Technical Concept:
- **`Math.floor()`** rounds the number down to the nearest integer.
- By multiplying **`Math.random()`** by a number, you extend the range. For example, multiplying by 10 makes the output range from 0 to 9 (since **`Math.floor()`** cuts off the decimals).

## More Examples of Random Integers

- **Random integer between 0 and 10**:
  ```javascript
  Math.floor(Math.random() * 11);
  ```
  This code generates a number between 0 and 10 (including both).

- **Random integer between 0 and 99**:
  ```javascript
  Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);
  ```

- **Random integer between 1 and 100**:
  ```javascript
  Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
  ```

### Explanation:
In the examples above, we multiply **`Math.random()`** by the desired range. To get numbers starting from 1, we simply add 1 to the result.

### Analogy:
Imagine a spinning wheel with 100 numbers, but the first position is 0. If you want the first number to be 1, you just shift the numbers forward by adding 1, which is what we do in the last line of code.

## Creating a Custom Random Number Function

Sometimes, you‚Äôll need to generate a random number within a specific range. Instead of repeating the same code every time, it's better to create a **reusable function**.

### Example:

```javascript
function getRndInteger(min, max) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min)) + min;
}
```

### What does this function do?

- **`min`**: The minimum value you want to get.
- **`max`**: The maximum value you want to get (not included).
- **`Math.random()`**: Generates a number between 0 and 1.
- **Multiplication**: By multiplying by **`(max - min)`**, we expand the range between **`min`** and **`max`**.
- **Addition**: By adding **`min`**, we shift the range so the lowest possible value is **`min`**.

### Example using the function:

```javascript
// Returns a number between 5 and 15 (excluding 15)
getRndInteger(5, 15);
```

### Function to Include the Maximum Value

If you want both the minimum and maximum values to be included in the range, you can adjust the function:

```javascript
function getRndIntegerInclusive(min, max) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
}
```

### Technical Explanation:

- Adding **1** to the **`(max - min)`** calculation ensures that the maximum number is included in the result.
  
### Example:

```javascript
// Returns a number between 1 and 100, including both limits
getRndIntegerInclusive(1, 100);
```

## Summary

- **`Math.random()`** is a powerful tool for generating random numbers between 0 and 1.
- Combining **`Math.random()`** with **`Math.floor()`** allows you to generate integers in any range you need.
- Creating reusable functions to generate random numbers within specific ranges is a good practice and saves you time when writing code.

# Booleans in JavaScript

## What is a Boolean in JavaScript?

Imagine you have a light switch on the wall. It only has two possible positions: ON or OFF. In programming, we often need a data type that can only have two possible values, like this switch. In JavaScript, this is called a **Boolean**, and the two values it can take are `true` (on) or `false` (off).

### Boolean Values
In programming, there are many situations where we only want to know if something is `yes` or `no`, `true` or `false`, like:
- Is the switch on?
- Is the person older than 18?
- Is the value greater than 10?

In these cases, we use a **Boolean**, which can only be `true` or `false`.

### Example:

```javascript
// Returns true, since 10 is greater than 9
Boolean(10 > 9);
```

Even simpler, you don't even need the `Boolean()` function. You can directly perform a comparison:

```javascript
// Returns true
10 > 9;
```

## Comparisons and Conditions

Boolean values are the foundation of comparisons and conditions in JavaScript. Here are some common examples:

| Operator  | Description       | Example                |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| ==        | Equal to           | `if (day == "Monday")` |
| >         | Greater than       | `if (salary > 9000)`   |
| <         | Less than          | `if (age < 18)`        |

### Technical concept:
When you perform comparisons like `10 > 9`, JavaScript returns a Boolean value (`true` or `false`), which you can then use in conditional statements like `if`.

## Everything that has a "value" is true

### Analogy:
Think of any number or word as physical objects. As long as you have something in your hands, no matter what it is, that counts as "true" (you have something). In JavaScript, anything that is not empty or `0` is considered **true**.

### Examples of values that are true (`true`):

```javascript
Boolean(100);      // true
Boolean(3.14);     // true
Boolean(-15);      // true
Boolean("Hello");  // true
Boolean("false");  // true
Boolean(7 + 1);    // true
```

- Any number that isn't 0 is `true`, even negative numbers.
- Any non-empty string, like `"Hello"` or even `"false"`, is also `true`.

## Everything without a "value" is false

### Analogy:
If your hands are empty, that means "false." In JavaScript, certain values are considered "empty" or **false**.

### Examples of values that are false (`false`):

```javascript
Boolean(0);          // false
Boolean(-0);         // false
Boolean("");         // false
Boolean(undefined);  // false
Boolean(null);       // false
Boolean(false);      // false
Boolean(NaN);        // false
```

- The number `0`, the empty string `""`, `undefined`, `null`, `false`, and `NaN` (Not a Number) are all considered **false**.

### Technical concept:
Any value that is considered "empty" or without value will be evaluated as `false`. This is useful in conditions where you only care if there is something or not, like checking if a user has entered data into a form.

## Booleans in JavaScript as Objects

Normally, Boolean values in JavaScript are **primitive**. This means they are simple values like `true` or `false` created directly, without much complexity.

### Example:

```javascript
let x = false;  // Primitive Boolean
```

However, you can also create booleans as **objects** using the `new` keyword:

```javascript
let y = new Boolean(false);  // Boolean as an object
```

### What‚Äôs the difference?

- **`typeof x`** will return `"boolean"` because `x` is a primitive Boolean value.
- **`typeof y`** will return `"object"` because `y` is an object created with `new Boolean()`.

### Warning: Don‚Äôt use booleans as objects!

- Creating booleans as objects (with `new`) complicates the code and slows it down.
- Additionally, it can cause unexpected results.

### Example of unexpected behavior:

When comparing a primitive Boolean with a Boolean object using the `==` operator, they appear to be equal:

```javascript
let x = false;
let y = new Boolean(false);
x == y;  // true
```

But when using the `===` operator, which compares both the value and the type, they are not equal:

```javascript
x === y;  // false
```

### Technical concept:
The `==` operator only compares the value, but the `===` operator compares both the value and the data type. Since `x` is a primitive Boolean and `y` is an object, `x === y` returns `false`.

### Summary:

- In JavaScript, booleans represent two values: `true` or `false`.
- Values that "have something" are considered `true` (like numbers or non-empty strings).
- Values that are "empty" are considered `false` (like `0`, `""`, `undefined`, `null`, etc.).
- Avoid using booleans as objects with `new Boolean()` because it complicates the code and can lead to unexpected behavior.

# JavaScript Comparison and Logical Operators

Comparison and logical operators are used to evaluate conditions and determine if they are true or false.

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine the equality or difference between variables or values.

### Comparison Operators Table

Given that `x = 5`, the following table explains the comparison operators:

| Operator | Description                           | Comparing          | Returns | Try it |
|----------|---------------------------------------|---------------------|---------|--------|
| `==`     | equal to                               | `x == 8`            | false   |        |
|          |                                       | `x == 5`            | true    |        |
|          |                                       | `x == "5"`          | true    |        |
| `===`    | equal value and equal type            | `x === 5`           | true    |        |
|          |                                       | `x === "5"`         | false   |        |
| `!=`     | not equal                              | `x != 8`            | true    |        |
| `!==`    | not equal value or not equal type     | `x !== 5`           | false   |        |
|          |                                       | `x !== "5"`         | true    |        |
|          |                                       | `x !== 8`           | true    |        |
| `>`      | greater than                           | `x > 8`             | false   |        |
| `<`      | less than                              | `x < 8`             | true    |        |
| `>=`     | greater than or equal to               | `x >= 8`            | false   |        |
| `<=`     | less than or equal to                 | `x <= 8`            | true    |        |

### How It Can Be Used

Comparison operators can be used in conditional statements to compare values and take actions depending on the result. For example:

```javascript
if (age < 18) text = "Too young to buy alcohol";
```

You will learn more about the use of conditional statements in the next chapter of this tutorial.

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

### Logical Operators Table

Given that `x = 6` and `y = 3`, the following table explains the logical operators:

| Operator | Description | Example                             | Try it |
|----------|-------------|-------------------------------------|--------|
| `&&`     | and         | `(x < 10 && y > 1)` is true        |        |
| `||`     | or          | `(x == 5 || y == 5)` is false      |        |
| `!`      | not         | `!(x == y)` is true                 |        |

### Analogy:
Imagine you have a box with two compartments. If you want both compartments to contain something for the box to be considered "full," you would use the `&&` (and) operator. If only one of the compartments needs to contain something, you would use `||` (or). And if you want to check that a compartment is empty, you would use `!` (not).

## Conditional (Ternary) Operator

JavaScript also contains a conditional operator that assigns a value to a variable based on some condition.

### Syntax

```javascript
variableName = (condition) ? value1 : value2;
```

### Example

```javascript
let voteable = (age < 18) ? "Too young" : "Old enough";
```

If the variable `age` is a value below 18, the value of the variable `voteable` will be "Too young"; otherwise, the value of `voteable` will be "Old enough".

## Comparing Different Types

Comparing data of different types may yield unexpected results.

When comparing a string with a number, JavaScript will convert the string to a number when making the comparison. An empty string converts to 0. A non-numeric string converts to NaN (Not a Number), which is always false.

### Comparison Examples

| Case                | Value | Try     |
|---------------------|-------|---------|
| `2 < 12`            | true  |         |
| `2 < "12"`          | true  |         |
| `2 < "John"`        | false |         |
| `2 > "John"`        | false |         |
| `2 == "John"`       | false |         |
| `"2" < "12"`        | false |         |
| `"2" > "12"`        | true  |         |
| `"2" == "12"`       | false |         |

When comparing two strings, "2" will be greater than "12" because (alphabetically) 1 is less than 2.

To secure a proper result, variables should be converted to the proper type before comparison:

```javascript
age = Number(age);
if (isNaN(age)) {
  voteable = "Input is not a number";
} else {
  voteable = (age < 18) ? "Too young" : "Old enough";
}
```

## The Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)

The `??` operator returns the first argument if it is not nullish (null or undefined). Otherwise, it returns the second argument.

### Example

```javascript
let name = null;
let text = "missing";
let result = name ?? text;
```

The nullish coalescing operator is supported in all browsers since March 2020.

| Browser   | Version  |
|-----------|----------|
| Chrome    | 80       |
| Edge      | 80       |
| Firefox    | 72      |
| Safari    | 13.1     |
| Opera     | 67       |

## The Optional Chaining Operator (?.)

The `?.` operator returns undefined if an object is undefined or null (instead of throwing an error).

### Example

```javascript
// Create an object:
const car = {type: "Fiat", model: "500", color: "white"};
// Ask for car name:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = car?.name;
```

The optional chaining operator is supported in all browsers since March 2020.

| Browser   | Version  |
|-----------|----------|
| Chrome    | 80       |
| Edge      | 80       |
| Firefox    | 72       |
| Safari    | 13.1     |
| Opera     | 67       |

# JavaScript: if, else, and else if

Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

## Conditional Statements

Very often, when you write code, you want to perform different actions based on different decisions.

You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In JavaScript, we have the following conditional statements:

- **if**: Specifies a block of code that will be executed if a specified condition is true.
- **else**: Specifies a block of code that will be executed if the same condition is false.
- **else if**: Specifies a new condition to test if the first condition is false.
- **switch**: Specifies many alternative blocks of code to be executed. The `switch` statement will be described in the next chapter.

## The if Statement

Use the `if` statement to specify a block of JavaScript code that will be executed if a condition is true.

### Syntax

```javascript
if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

**Note**: `if` must be written in lowercase. Uppercase letters (If or IF) will generate a JavaScript error.

### Example

Make a "Good day" greeting if the hour is less than 18:00:

```javascript
if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";
}
```

The result of `greeting` will be:

```
Good day
```

### Analogy

Imagine you are a chef in a restaurant. You have to decide what dish to prepare based on the time of day. If it‚Äôs before 18:00, you decide to prepare lunch (i.e., "Good day"). But if that time has passed, you might consider serving dinner.

---

## The else Statement

Use the `else` statement to specify a block of code that will be executed if the condition is false.

### Syntax

```javascript
if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

### Example

If the hour is less than 18, create a "Good day" greeting; otherwise, create a "Good evening":

```javascript
if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}
```

The result of `greeting` will be:

```
Good day
```

### Analogy

Continuing with the chef analogy: if you decide it‚Äôs lunchtime, you‚Äôll serve a light dish. If it‚Äôs late and dinner time has arrived, you choose to serve a heavier, more elaborate dish, meaning "Good evening".

---

## The else if Statement

Use the `else if` statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

### Syntax

```javascript
if (condition1) {
  //  block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  //  block of code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  //  block of code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}
```

### Example

If the hour is less than 10:00, create a "Good morning" greeting; if not, but the hour is less than 20:00, create a "Good day" greeting; otherwise, create a "Good evening":

```javascript
if (hour < 10) {
  greeting = "Good morning";
} else if (hour < 20) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}
```

The result of `greeting` will be:

```
Good day
```

### Analogy

Imagine you are a receptionist at a hotel. If a guest arrives very early (before 10:00), you welcome them with a warm "Good morning!". If they arrive during the day (before 20:00), you also greet them with "Good day!". But if they arrive late at night, you say "Good evening!" because that is the appropriate time for it.

---

## More Examples

### Random Link Example

This example will write a link to either W3Schools or the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF). By using a random number, there is a 50% chance for each of the links.

```javascript
let randomNumber = Math.random();
if (randomNumber < 0.5) {
  document.write('<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>');
} else {
  document.write('<a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org">Visit WWF</a>');
}
```

### Analogy

Think of it like a game of chance, like rolling a die. If you roll a number less than 4, you win a prize. If you roll a number 4 or higher, you win nothing. Similarly, this code randomly chooses between two links.

---

# JavaScript: Switch Statement

The `switch` statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

## The Switch Statement in JavaScript

Use the `switch` statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

### Syntax

```javascript
switch (expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}
```

### How It Works

1. The `switch` expression is evaluated once.
2. The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
3. If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
4. If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

### Example

The `getDay()` method returns the weekday as a number between 0 and 6 (Sunday=0, Monday=1, Tuesday=2, etc.).

This example uses the weekday number to calculate the name of the day:

```javascript
switch (new Date().getDay()) {
  case 0:
    day = "Sunday";
    break;
  case 1:
    day = "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
    day = "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    day = "Wednesday";
    break;
  case 4:
    day = "Thursday";
    break;
  case 5:
    day = "Friday";
    break;
  case 6:
    day = "Saturday";
}
```

The result of `day` will be:

```
Wednesday
```

### Analogy

Imagine you are an event organizer. Each day of the week has a special event. You use a `switch` to decide what event happens based on the current day. If it‚Äôs Sunday, you prepare a brunch; if it‚Äôs Monday, a seminar, and so on.

---

## The Break Keyword

When JavaScript reaches a `break` keyword, it breaks out of the `switch` block.

This stops the execution inside the `switch` block.

It is not necessary to break the last case in a `switch` block, as the block ends there anyway.

**Note**: If you omit the `break` statement, the next case will be executed even if the evaluation does not match the case.

### Example

If the expression matches case 1, the corresponding block will execute and then exit the `switch` thanks to the `break`.

---

## The Default Keyword

The `default` keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match:

### Example

If today is neither Saturday (6) nor Sunday (0), write a default message:

```javascript
switch (new Date().getDay()) {
  case 6:
    text = "Today is Saturday";
    break;
  case 0:
    text = "Today is Sunday";
    break;
  default:
    text = "Looking forward to the Weekend";
}
```

The result of `text` will be:

```
Looking forward to the Weekend
```

### Analogy

If you are the chef of a restaurant and someone arrives on a Monday, if you don‚Äôt have a special menu, you offer a generic message like "Looking forward to the Weekend," because you might have special dishes only on weekends.

---

## Common Code Blocks

Sometimes you will want different `switch` cases to use the same code.

### Example

In this example, cases 4 and 5 share the same code block, and 0 and 6 share another block:

```javascript
switch (new Date().getDay()) {
  case 4:
  case 5:
    text = "Soon it is Weekend";
    break;
  case 0:
  case 6:
    text = "It is Weekend";
    break;
  default:
    text = "Looking forward to the Weekend";
}
```

### Analogy

Imagine you are a master of ceremonies. If it‚Äôs Thursday or Friday, you say "Soon it is Weekend!" But if it‚Äôs Saturday or Sunday, you celebrate by saying "It is Weekend!"

---

## Switching Details

- If multiple cases match a case value, the first case is selected.
- If no matching cases are found, the program continues to the `default` label.
- If no `default` label is found, the program continues to the statement(s) after the `switch`.

### Strict Comparison

Switch cases use strict comparison (===). The values must be of the same type to match.

In this example, there will be no match for `x`:

```javascript
let x = "0";
switch (x) {
  case 0:
    text = "Off";
    break;
  case 1:
    text = "On";
    break;
  default:
    text = "No value found";
}
```

### Analogy

Think of a remote control. If you press the power button and the remote is set to "turn on," but you only press the wrong button, there will be no match.

---

# JavaScript: For Loop

Loops can execute a block of code multiple times.

## Loops in JavaScript

Loops are handy if you want to run the same code repeatedly, each time with a different value.

This is especially common when working with arrays:

Instead of writing:

```javascript
text += cars[0] + "<br>";
text += cars[1] + "<br>";
text += cars[2] + "<br>";
text += cars[3] + "<br>";
text += cars[4] + "<br>";
text += cars[5] + "<br>";
```

You can write:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}
```

## Different Types of Loops

JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

- **for**: loops through a block of code a specific number of times.
- **for/in**: loops through the properties of an object.
- **for/of**: loops through the values of an iterable object.
- **while**: loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.
- **do/while**: also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.

## The For Loop

The `for` statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions:

```javascript
for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

- **Expression 1** is executed (once) before the execution of the code block.
- **Expression 2** defines the condition for executing the code block.
- **Expression 3** is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

### Example

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
```

From the example above, you can read:

- **Expression 1** sets a variable before the loop starts (`let i = 0`).
- **Expression 2** defines the condition for the loop to run (`i must be less than 5`).
- **Expression 3** increments a value (`i++`) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.

### Expression 1

Normally, you will use expression 1 to initialize the variable used in the loop (`let i = 0`).

This is not always the case. JavaScript doesn't care. Expression 1 is optional.

You can initiate multiple values in expression 1 (separated by commas):

#### Example

```javascript
for (let i = 0, len = cars.length, text = ""; i < len; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}
```

And you can omit expression 1 (like when your values are set before the loop starts):

#### Example

```javascript
let i = 2;
let len = cars.length;
let text = "";
for (; i < len; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}
```

### Expression 2

Often, expression 2 is used to evaluate the condition of the initial variable.

This is not always the case. JavaScript doesn't care. Expression 2 is also optional.

If expression 2 returns true, the loop will start over again. If it returns false, the loop will end.

If you omit expression 2, you must provide a `break` inside the loop. Otherwise, the loop will never end. This can crash your browser. Read about breaks in a later chapter of this tutorial.

### Expression 3

Often, expression 3 increments the value of the initial variable.

This is not always the case. JavaScript doesn't care. Expression 3 is optional.

Expression 3 can do anything like negative increment (`i--`), positive increment (`i = i + 15`), or anything else.

Expression 3 can also be omitted (like when you increment your values inside the loop):

#### Example

```javascript
let i = 0;
let len = cars.length;
let text = "";
for (; i < len; ) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
  i++;
}
```

## Loop Scope

### Using var in a loop:

```javascript
var i = 5;

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // some code
}

// Here i is 10
```

### Using let in a loop:

```javascript
let i = 5;

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // some code
}

// Here i is 5
```

In the first example, using `var`, the variable declared in the loop redeclares the variable outside the loop.

In the second example, using `let`, the variable declared in the loop does not redeclare the variable outside the loop.

When `let` is used to declare the variable `i` in a loop, the variable `i` will only be visible within the loop.

## For/Of and For/In Loops

The `for/in` loop and the `for/of` loop are explained in the next chapter.

## While Loops

The `while` loop and the `do/while` are explained in the next chapters.

### Analogy to Understand Loops

Imagine you are organizing an event and need to invite several people. Instead of writing an invitation for each person manually, you can use a loop.

Each time you call the guest list (like an array), the loop takes care of sending an invitation to each one of them. It's much more efficient and faster.

That's how loops work: they automate repetitive tasks, allowing you to focus on other important parts of your event.

---

# JavaScript: For In

## The For In Loop

The JavaScript `for...in` statement loops through the properties of an object.

### Syntax

```javascript
for (key in object) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

### Example

```javascript
const person = {fname: "John", lname: "Doe", age: 25};

let text = "";
for (let x in person) {
  text += person[x];
}
```

### Example Explained

1. **Iterating Over an Object**: The `for...in` loop iterates over the `person` object.
2. **Iteration Key**: In each iteration, a key (in this case, `x`) is returned.
3. **Accessing Value**: The key is used to access the value of the object's property.
4. **Value of the Key**: The value of the key is retrieved using `person[x]`, which represents the value corresponding to the current key.

### Simple Analogy

Imagine you have a closet with several shelves (each shelf is a property of the object). If you want to see what's on each shelf, you can use a `for...in` loop to look at each one. So, every time you check a shelf (a key), you can take out what‚Äôs on it (the value of that key).

---

## For In Over Arrays

The JavaScript `for...in` statement can also loop over the properties of an array.

### Syntax

```javascript
for (variable in array) {
  // code
}
```

### Example

```javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];

let txt = "";
for (let x in numbers) {
  txt += numbers[x];
}
```

### Caution

Do not use `for...in` over an array if the index order is important. The index order is implementation-dependent, and array values may not be accessed in the order you expect.

It's better to use a `for` loop, a `for...of` loop, or `Array.forEach()` when the order is important.

---

## Array.forEach()

The `forEach()` method calls a function (a callback function) once for each array element.

### Example

```javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];

let txt = "";
numbers.forEach(myFunction);

function myFunction(value, index, array) {
  txt += value;
}
```

### Function Arguments

Note that the function takes 3 arguments:

- **The item value**
- **The item index**
- **The array itself**

The example above uses only the value parameter. It can be rewritten as follows:

### Simplified Example

```javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];

let txt = "";
numbers.forEach(myFunction);

function myFunction(value) {
  txt += value;
}
```

### Analogy for forEach()

Imagine you are organizing a party and need to invite each of your friends. Instead of sending invitations one by one, you can use `forEach()` like a guest list. Each time you call a friend from the list (each element of the array), you send them the invitation (execute the function). This helps you ensure that each friend gets their invitation efficiently without forgetting anyone.

---

# JavaScript: For Of

## The For Of Loop

The `for...of` statement in JavaScript iterates over the values of an iterable object. This allows you to loop over iterable data structures such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more.

### Syntax

```javascript
for (variable of iterable) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

- **variable**: For every iteration, the value of the next property is assigned to the variable. The variable can be declared with `const`, `let`, or `var`.
- **iterable**: An object that has iterable properties.

### Browser Support

The `for...of` loop was added to JavaScript in 2015 (ES6). The first browser to support `for...of` was Safari 7:

| Browser     | Version | Release Date |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| Chrome      | 38      | Oct 2014     |
| Edge        | 12      | Jul 2015     |
| Firefox     | 51      | Oct 2016     |
| Safari      | 7       | Oct 2013     |
| Opera       | 25      | Oct 2014     |

Note that `for...of` is not supported in Internet Explorer.

---

## Looping Over an Array

### Example

```javascript
const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];

let text = "";
for (let x of cars) {
  text += x;
}
```

### Explanation

In this example, the `for...of` loop iterates over the `cars` array. In each iteration, the value of `x` is assigned to the next element in the array, and then it is added to the `text` variable.

### Analogy

Imagine you have a box of chocolates. Each time you open the box, you take a chocolate (an element of the array). Instead of counting the chocolates (using indices), you simply eat them one by one until they are gone. That‚Äôs how `for...of` works: you take the value directly without worrying about its position.

---

## Looping Over a String

### Example

```javascript
let language = "JavaScript";

let text = "";
for (let x of language) {
  text += x;
}
```

### Explanation

Here, the `for...of` loop iterates over the `language` string. In each iteration, a character from the string is taken and added to `text`.

### Analogy

Imagine you are reading a book. Each time you turn the page, you see a letter (a character from the string). Instead of counting how many letters are left in the book, you simply keep reading one by one. That‚Äôs what `for...of` does: it goes through the characters without worrying about their index.

---

# JavaScript: While Loop

## Loops

Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

## The While Loop

The `while` loop iterates through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

### Syntax

```javascript
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

### Example

In the following example, the code in the loop will run repeatedly as long as the variable `i` is less than 10:

```javascript
let i = 0; // Initialize the variable
let text = "";

while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i + "\n"; // Concatenate the text
  i++; // Increment i by 1
}
```

### Warning

If you forget to increase the variable used in the condition, the loop will never end, which could crash your browser. Always ensure that the condition eventually becomes false.

### Analogy

Imagine you are filling a bucket with water. Each time you pour water into the bucket (executing the code), you check if the bucket is full (evaluating the condition). If you don't increase the water level in the bucket (don't increment the variable), the bucket will never fill up, and you'll keep pouring water endlessly.

---

## The Do While Loop

The `do while` loop is a variant of the `while` loop. This loop will execute the code block at least once before checking if the condition is true, and then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition remains true.

### Syntax

```javascript
do {
  // code block to be executed
} while (condition);
```

### Example

In the following example, the `do while` loop will always execute at least once, even if the condition is false:

```javascript
let i = 0; // Initialize the variable
let text = "";

do {
  text += "The number is " + i + "\n"; // Concatenate the text
  i++; // Increment i by 1
} while (i < 10);
```

### Warning

Just like with the `while` loop, don't forget to increase the variable used in the condition. Otherwise, the loop will never end.

### Analogy

Think of a game where you have to roll a die. You roll the die (execute the code) at least once. After each roll, you decide if you want to keep playing (evaluate the condition). If you haven't set a limit on how many times to roll the die, you could end up rolling it indefinitely.

---

## Comparing For and While

If you've read the previous chapter about the `for` loop, you‚Äôll find that a `while` loop is very similar to a `for` loop, with the first and third statements omitted.

### For Loop Example

```javascript
const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Saab", "Ford"];
let i = 0; // Initialize the index
let text = "";

for (; cars[i];) {
  text += cars[i]; // Concatenate the text
  i++; // Increment i by 1
}
```

### While Loop Example

```javascript
const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Saab", "Ford"];
let i = 0; // Initialize the index
let text = "";

while (cars[i]) {
  text += cars[i]; // Concatenate the text
  i++; // Increment i by 1
}
```

---

# JavaScript: Break and Continue

In JavaScript, the `break` and `continue` statements allow you to control the flow of loops effectively.

## The Break Statement

The `break` statement "jumps out" of a loop.

### Example

In this example, the loop stops when the counter (i) is equal to 3:

```javascript
let text = "";
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 3) { 
    break; 
  }
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
```

### Explanation

- The loop starts at 0 and increments up to 10.
- When `i` is equal to 3, the `break` statement is executed, causing the loop to stop immediately.
- Therefore, the output will be: "The number is 0", "The number is 1", and "The number is 2".

### Analogy

Imagine you are playing a board game, and every time you reach square 3, you decide you‚Äôve had enough and leave the game (executing `break`). You no longer continue moving on the board.

---

## The Continue Statement

The `continue` statement "jumps over" one iteration in the loop. When a specified condition is met, it skips the rest of the code in that iteration and continues with the next one.

### Example

In this case, the value 3 is skipped:

```javascript
let text = "";
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 3) { 
    continue; 
  }
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
```

### Explanation

- Here, the loop iterates from 0 to 9.
- When `i` is equal to 3, the `continue` statement is executed, causing the loop to skip that iteration.
- Therefore, the output will be: "The number is 0", "The number is 1", "The number is 2", "The number is 4", "The number is 5", etc.

### Analogy

Imagine you are in a line to enter a store, and you decide to skip the person in the 3rd position because they are taking too long. You continue moving forward in the line and leave that person behind (executing `continue`).

---

## Labels in JavaScript

To label JavaScript statements, precede the statements with a label name and a colon:

```javascript
label:
statements
```

The `break` and `continue` statements are the only JavaScript statements that can "jump out of" a code block.

### Syntax

- For the `break` statement with a label:

```javascript
break labelname;
```

- For the `continue` statement with a label:

```javascript
continue labelname;
```

### Example with a Label

Here‚Äôs an example using a label:

```javascript
const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Saab", "Ford"];
list: {
  text += cars[0] + "<br>";
  text += cars[1] + "<br>";
  break list; // Jumps out of the "list" block
  text += cars[2] + "<br>";
  text += cars[3] + "<br>";
}
```

### Explanation

- In this example, the code block labeled `list` executes.
- When the `break list` statement is encountered, the flow exits the labeled block, and the lines following it do not execute.

---

# JavaScript Iterables

Iterables are objects that can be iterated over (like arrays).

Iterables can be accessed with simple and efficient code, and they can be iterated with `for..of` loops.

## The For Of Loop

The `for..of` statement in JavaScript loops through the elements of an iterable object.

### Syntax

```javascript
for (variable of iterable) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

### Iteration

Iteration is easy to understand. It simply means looping over a sequence of elements.

### Easy Examples:

- Iterating over a string
- Iterating over an array

## Iterating Over a String

You can use a `for..of` loop to iterate over the elements of a string:

### Example

```javascript
const name = "W3Schools";

for (const x of name) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

### Analogy

Imagine you are reading a book. Each time you turn a page, you see a new letter (or word). In this case, each letter of the string is like a page being "read" in each iteration of the loop.

---

## Iterating Over an Array

You can use a `for..of` loop to iterate over the elements of an array:

### Example 1

```javascript
const letters = ["a", "b", "c"];

for (const x of letters) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

### Example 2

```javascript
const numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8];

for (const x of numbers) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

### Analogy

Think of an array like a fruit platter. Each fruit (or element) is an object on the platter. Using `for..of` is like picking each fruit one by one and examining it.

---

## Iterating Over a Set

You can use a `for..of` loop to iterate over the elements of a Set:

### Example

```javascript
const letters = new Set(["a", "b", "c"]);

for (const x of letters) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

### Note

Sets and Maps are covered in the next chapters.

---

## Iterating Over a Map

You can use a `for..of` loop to iterate over the elements of a Map:

### Example

```javascript
const fruits = new Map([
  ["apples", 500],
  ["bananas", 300],
  ["oranges", 200]
]);

for (const x of fruits) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

### Analogy

Imagine a Map like a phone directory. Each entry has a name (key) and a phone number (value). When using `for..of`, you are going through each entry in the directory and seeing the name and phone number.

---

## JavaScript Iterators

The iterator protocol defines how to produce a sequence of values from an object.

An object becomes an iterator when it implements a `next()` method.

### The next() Method

The `next()` method must return an object with two properties:

- **value**: the next value
- **done**: (true or false)

**value**: The value returned by the iterator (can be omitted if done is true).

**done**: true if the iterator has completed, false if the iterator has produced a new value.

### Note

Technically, iterables must implement the `Symbol.iterator` method.

Strings, arrays, TypedArrays, Maps, and Sets are all iterables because their prototype objects have a `Symbol.iterator` method.

---

## Home Made Iterable

This iterable returns an endless sequence: 10, 20, 30, 40,... Every time `next()` is called:

### Example

```javascript
// Home Made Iterable
function myNumbers() {
  let n = 0;
  return {
    next: function() {
      n += 10;
      return { value: n, done: false };
    }
  };
}

// Create Iterable
const n = myNumbers();
n.next(); // Returns 10
n.next(); // Returns 20
n.next(); // Returns 30
```

### Problem with a Home Made Iterable

It does not support the JavaScript `for..of` statement. A JavaScript iterable is an object that has a `Symbol.iterator`.

The `Symbol.iterator` is a function that returns a `next()` function.

An iterable can be iterated over with the code:

```javascript
for (const x of iterable) {
  // Any code here
}
```

### Example

```javascript
// Create an Object
myNumbers = {};

// Make it Iterable
myNumbers[Symbol.iterator] = function() {
  let n = 0;
  done = false;
  return {
    next() {
      n += 10;
      if (n == 100) { done = true; }
      return { value: n, done: done };
    }
  };
}
```

Now you can use `for..of`:

```javascript
for (const num of myNumbers) {
  // Any code here
}
```

The `Symbol.iterator` method is called automatically by `for..of`. But we can also do it "manually":

### Manual Example

```javascript
let iterator = myNumbers[Symbol.iterator]();

while (true) {
  const result = iterator.next();
  if (result.done) break;
  // Any code here
}
```

### Analogy

Imagine you are a mail carrier. Your job is to deliver letters (values) to each recipient (iteration). Each time you deliver a letter, you decide if there are more letters to deliver (done). If there are no more letters, you simply finish the delivery.

---

# JavaScript Sets

A **Set** in JavaScript is a collection of unique values. This means that each value can only occur once in a Set.

The values in a Set can be of any type, including primitive values or objects.

## How to Create a Set

You can create a JavaScript Set in the following ways:

1. By passing an array to the `new Set()` constructor.
2. By creating an empty Set and using the `add()` method to add values.

### The new Set() Method

To create a Set, you can pass an array to the `new Set()` constructor:

#### Example

```javascript
// Create a Set
const letters = new Set(["a", "b", "c"]);
```

### Create a Set and Add Values

You can also create an empty Set and use the `add()` method to add values:

#### Example

```javascript
// Create a Set
const letters = new Set();

// Add Values to the Set
letters.add("a");
letters.add("b");
letters.add("c");
```

### Create a Set and Add Variables

Another option is to create a Set and then add variables:

#### Example

```javascript
// Create a Set
const letters = new Set();

// Create Variables
const a = "a";
const b = "b";
const c = "c";

// Add Variables to the Set
letters.add(a);
letters.add(b);
letters.add(c);
```

## The add() Method

You can use the `add()` method to add elements to the Set. If you try to add duplicate elements, only the first one will be kept:

#### Example

```javascript
letters.add("d");
letters.add("e");
letters.add("a"); // Only the first will be saved
```

In the next example, attempting to add the same value multiple times will not change the Set:

#### Example

```javascript
letters.add("a");
letters.add("b");
letters.add("c");
letters.add("c"); // Ignored
letters.add("c"); // Ignored
letters.add("c"); // Ignored
```

### Listing the Elements

You can list all the elements of a Set using a `for..of` loop:

#### Example

```javascript
// Create a Set
const letters = new Set(["a", "b", "c"]);

// List all Elements
let text = "";
for (const x of letters) {
  text += x;
}
console.log(text); // Output: abc
```

### Sets Are Objects

In JavaScript, Sets are a type of object. You can check the type using `typeof`, and you can also verify if it is an instance of Set using `instanceof`.

#### Example

```javascript
typeof letters;      // Returns "object"
letters instanceof Set;  // Returns true
```

## Analogies to Understand Sets

Imagine that a Set is like a toy box. You can only have one type of toy for each category. If you try to put two toys of the same type (for example, two soccer balls), only one will remain in the box. This unique characteristic of Sets ensures that each toy (or value) is distinct.

Just like in a toy box, you can open the box (using a `for..of` loop) and take out each toy (value) to play with, always remembering that you can‚Äôt have duplicates.

---

# JavaScript Set Methods

**Sets** in JavaScript are collections of unique values. Below, we will explore some of the most commonly used methods for working with Sets, along with examples and analogies to make the concepts easier to understand.

## The new Set() Method

To create a Set, you can pass an array to the `new Set()` constructor:

### Example

```javascript
// Create a Set
const letters = new Set(["a", "b", "c"]);
```

### Analogy

Think of a Set as a toolbox. When you buy a set of tools, each tool (value) comes in its own space, and you can't have two of the same tool in the same space. That's how a Set works: you can only have one instance of each value.

## The add() Method

You can add values to a Set using the `add()` method. If you try to add duplicate values, only the first occurrence will be saved.

### Example

```javascript
letters.add("d");
letters.add("e");

// If you try to add equal elements, only the first will be saved
letters.add("a");
letters.add("b");
letters.add("c");
letters.add("c"); // Ignored
```

### Analogy

Continuing with the toolbox analogy, if you try to put two hammers in the same space, only one will remain in the box. So, when you add a value that already exists, the Set ignores the new value.

## Listing Set Elements

You can list all the elements in a Set using a `for..of` loop.

### Example

```javascript
// Create a Set
const letters = new Set(["a", "b", "c"]);

// List all Elements
let text = "";
for (const x of letters) {
  text += x;
}
console.log(text); // Output: abc
```

### Analogy

Imagine you are taking tools out of your toolbox and showing each one to your friends. With the `for..of` loop, you can display each tool (value) that is in your box (Set).

## The has() Method

The `has()` method returns `true` if a specified value exists in a Set.

### Example

```javascript
// Create a Set
const letters = new Set(["a", "b", "c"]);

// Does the Set contain "d"?
const answer = letters.has("d"); // false
```

### Analogy

It's like checking if you have a specific tool in your toolbox. Asking yourself "Do I have a screwdriver?" would be like using the `has()` method. If the tool is there, you get a positive answer; otherwise, you do not.

## The forEach() Method

The `forEach()` method invokes a function for each element in the Set.

### Example

```javascript
// Create a Set
const letters = new Set(["a", "b", "c"]);

// List all entries
let text = "";
letters.forEach(function(value) {
  text += value;
});
console.log(text); // Output: abc
```

### Analogy

Imagine you ask a friend to list all the tools in your toolbox. The `forEach()` method acts like that friend, mentioning each tool one by one.

## The values() Method

The `values()` method returns an iterator object with the values in a Set.

### Example 1

```javascript
// Create a Set
const letters = new Set(["a", "b", "c"]);

// Get all Values
const myIterator = letters.values();

// List all Values
let text = "";
for (const entry of myIterator) {
  text += entry;
}
console.log(text); // Output: abc
```

### Example 2

```javascript
// Create a Set
const letters = new Set(["a", "b", "c"]);

// List all Values
let text = "";
for (const entry of letters.values()) {
  text += entry;
}
console.log(text); // Output: abc
```

### Analogy

Think of the `values()` method like a directory of tools. It gives you easy access to each tool (value) in the box (Set), allowing you to list them all.

## The keys() Method

The `keys()` method returns an iterator object with the values in a Set.

### Note

A Set has no keys, so `keys()` returns the same as `values()`. This makes Sets compatible with Maps.

### Example 1

```javascript
// Create a Set
const letters = new Set(["a", "b", "c"]);

// Create an Iterator
const myIterator = letters.keys();

// List all Elements
let text = "";
for (const x of myIterator) {
  text += x;
}
console.log(text); // Output: abc
```

### Example 2

```javascript
// Create a Set
const letters = new Set(["a", "b", "c"]);

// List all Elements
let text = "";
for (const x of letters.keys()) {
  text += x;
}
console.log(text); // Output: abc
```

### Analogy

The `keys()` method is like having a map of your toolbox. Even though there are no keys, you can see what tools are available. This is similar to how `keys()` and `values()` give you access to the same values.

## The entries() Method

The `entries()` method returns an iterator with [value, value] pairs from a Set.

### Note

The `entries()` method is supposed to return a [key, value] pair from an object. Since a Set has no keys, the `entries()` method returns [value, value]. This makes Sets compatible with Maps.

### Example 1

```javascript
// Create a Set
const letters = new Set(["a", "b", "c"]);

// Get all Entries
const myIterator = letters.entries();

// List all Entries
let text = "";
for (const entry of myIterator) {
  text += entry;
}
console.log(text); // Output: abcabc
```

### Example 2

```javascript
// Create a Set
const letters = new Set(["a", "b", "c"]);

// List all Entries
let text = "";
for (const entry of letters.entries()) {
  text += entry;
}
console.log(text); // Output: abcabc
```

### Analogy

The `entries()` method is like receiving a list of tools with a description of each one. Although there are no actual keys, you can see what tools you have and their respective "descriptions" (values).

# JavaScript Maps

A **Map** in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs where the keys can be any data type. Unlike objects, a Map remembers the original insertion order of the keys.

## How to Create a Map

You can create a Map in JavaScript in the following ways:

1. Passing an Array to the `new Map()` constructor
2. Creating a Map and using the `Map.set()` method

### The new Map() Method

You can create a Map by passing an Array to the `new Map()` constructor:

#### Example

```javascript
// Create a Map
const fruits = new Map([
  ["apples", 500],
  ["bananas", 300],
  ["oranges", 200]
]);
```

### Analogy

Think of a Map as a shelf where you place fruits. Each fruit (key) has a quantity (value). When you create a Map, it‚Äôs like placing those fruits on a shelf, remembering how many you have of each type.

## The set() Method

You can add elements to a Map using the `set()` method:

#### Example

```javascript
// Create a Map
const fruits = new Map();

// Set Map Values
fruits.set("apples", 500);
fruits.set("bananas", 300);
fruits.set("oranges", 200);
```

The `set()` method can also be used to change existing Map values:

#### Example

```javascript
fruits.set("apples", 200);
```

### Analogy

Think of the `set()` method as an assistant organizing your fruits on the shelf. If you decide to change the number of apples you have, you simply tell the assistant to update it.

## The get() Method

The `get()` method retrieves the value of a key in a Map:

#### Example

```javascript
fruits.get("apples"); // Returns 500
```

### Analogy

Using `get()` is like asking your assistant how many apples are on the shelf. He will respond with the exact quantity.

## Maps are Objects

When you use `typeof` on a Map, it returns "object":

#### Example

```javascript
// Returns object:
typeof fruits; // "object"
```

The `instanceof` operator returns `true` if an object is an instance of Map:

#### Example

```javascript
// Returns true:
fruits instanceof Map; // true
```

### Analogy

Maps are like a special category of objects in JavaScript. While they are objects, they have unique properties that make them different and more organized.

## Differences between JavaScript Objects and Maps

Here are some key differences between JavaScript objects and Maps:

| **Object**                             | **Map**                             |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Not directly iterable                  | Directly iterable                   |
| Do not have a size property            | Have a size property                |
| Keys must be Strings (or Symbols)     | Keys can be any data type          |
| Keys are not well ordered              | Keys are ordered by insertion       |
| Have default keys                      | Do not have default keys            |

### Analogy

Think of objects as messy storage boxes where items are piled up without any specific order. In contrast, Maps are like organized shelves where each item has its place, and you can easily access them.

## Complete Map Reference

For a complete reference, check out our [Complete JavaScript Map Reference](#).

The reference contains descriptions and examples of all Map properties and methods.

## Browser Support

Map is an ES6 feature (JavaScript 2015). ES6 is fully supported in all modern browsers since June 2017:

| Browser     | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| Chrome      | 51      |
| Edge        | 15      |
| Firefox     | 54      |
| Safari      | 10      |
| Opera       | 38      |

**Note:** Map is not supported in Internet Explorer.

# JavaScript Map Methods

A **Map** in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs where the keys can be of any data type. Here we will explore various methods you can use with Maps and how they work.

## The new Map() Method

You can create a map by passing an array to the `new Map()` constructor:

### Example

```javascript
// Create a Map
const fruits = new Map([
  ["apples", 500],
  ["bananas", 300],
  ["oranges", 200]
]);
```

### Analogy

Imagine the map is a pantry where you store different fruits. Each type of fruit (key) has an associated quantity (value).

## Map.get()

To get the value of a key in a map, the `get()` method is used:

### Example

```javascript
fruits.get("apples"); // Returns 500
```

### Analogy

It's like asking a friend how many apples you have in the pantry. They will tell you the exact amount.

## Map.set()

You can add elements to a map with the `set()` method:

### Example

```javascript
// Create a Map
const fruits = new Map();

// Set Map Values
fruits.set("apples", 500);
fruits.set("bananas", 300);
fruits.set("oranges", 200);
```

The `set()` method can also be used to change existing map values:

### Example

```javascript
fruits.set("apples", 400); // Changes the quantity of apples
```

### Analogy

Imagine you're reorganizing your pantry. If you decide to change the quantity of apples, you just tell your friend to update the number.

## Map.size

The `size` property returns the number of elements in a map:

### Example

```javascript
fruits.size; // Returns 3
```

### Analogy

It's like counting how many different fruits you have in your pantry.

## Map.delete()

The `delete()` method removes an element from the map:

### Example

```javascript
fruits.delete("apples"); // Removes apples
```

### Analogy

It's like taking a fruit out of the pantry. After using it, it's no longer there.

## Map.clear()

The `clear()` method removes all the elements from a map:

### Example

```javascript
fruits.clear(); // Empties the pantry
```

### Analogy

It's like completely emptying your pantry.

## Map.has()

The `has()` method returns `true` if a key exists in the map:

### Example

```javascript
fruits.has("apples"); // Returns false if apples were deleted
```

### Analogy

It's like asking if you still have apples in your pantry. If they‚Äôre not there, the answer is "no".

### Try This

```javascript
fruits.delete("apples"); // Deletes apples
fruits.has("apples"); // Checks if apples still exist
```

## Map.forEach()

The `forEach()` method invokes a callback for each key/value pair in a map:

### Example

```javascript
// List all entries
let text = "";
fruits.forEach(function(value, key) {
  text += key + ' = ' + value + "\n";
});
```

### Analogy

It's like taking inventory of all the fruits you have. You go through each fruit, naming it and its quantity.

## Map.entries()

The `entries()` method returns an iterator object with the [key, value] pairs in a map:

### Example

```javascript
// List all entries
let text = "";
for (const x of fruits.entries()) {
  text += x[0] + " = " + x[1] + "\n";
}
```

### Analogy

Imagine your pantry has labels on each shelf indicating what fruits are there and how many.

## Map.keys()

The `keys()` method returns an iterator object with the keys in a map:

### Example

```javascript
// List all keys
let text = "";
for (const x of fruits.keys()) {
  text += x + "\n";
}
```

### Analogy

It's like making a list of all the fruits you have in the pantry.

## Map.values()

The `values()` method returns an iterator object with the values in a map:

### Example

```javascript
// List all values
let text = "";
for (const x of fruits.values()) {
  text += x + "\n";
}
```

You can use the `values()` method to sum the values in a map:

### Example

```javascript
// Sum all values
let total = 0;
for (const x of fruits.values()) {
  total += x;
}
```

### Analogy

It's like counting how many fruits you have in total in your pantry.

## Objects as Keys

An important feature of Maps is that you can use objects as keys.

### Example

```javascript
// Create Objects
const apples = {name: 'Apples'};
const bananas = {name: 'Bananas'};
const oranges = {name: 'Oranges'};

// Create a Map
const fruits = new Map();

// Add new Elements to the Map
fruits.set(apples, 500);
fruits.set(bananas, 300);
fruits.set(oranges, 200);
```

Remember: the key is an object (`apples`), not a string (`"apples"`):

### Example

```javascript
fruits.get("apples"); // Returns undefined
```

### Analogy

It's like using a picture of a fruit instead of its name to identify it in your pantry. If you search by name, you won‚Äôt find it.

## JavaScript Map.groupBy()

ES2024 added the `Map.groupBy()` method to JavaScript.

The `Map.groupBy()` method groups elements of an object according to string values returned from a callback function. This method does not change the original object.

### Example

```javascript
// Create an Array
const fruits = [
  {name: "apples", quantity: 300},
  {name: "bananas", quantity: 500},
  {name: "oranges", quantity: 200},
  {name: "kiwi", quantity: 150}
];

// Callback function to Group Elements
function myCallback({ quantity }) {
  return quantity > 200 ? "ok" : "low";
}

// Group by Quantity
const result = Map.groupBy(fruits, myCallback);
```

## Browser Support

`Map.groupBy()` is an ES2024 feature and is supported in new browsers since March 2024:

| Browser    | Version |
|------------|---------|
| Chrome     | 117     |
| Edge       | 117     |
| Firefox    | 119     |
| Safari     | 17.4    |
| Opera      | 103     |

### Warning

ES2024 features are relatively new. Older browsers may need alternative code (Polyfill).

## Object.groupBy() vs Map.groupBy()

The difference between `Object.groupBy()` and `Map.groupBy()` is:

- `Object.groupBy()` groups elements into a JavaScript object.
- `Map.groupBy()` groups elements into a Map object.

# JavaScript: Understanding the `typeof` Operator

## The `typeof` Operator

The `typeof` operator returns the data type of a variable in JavaScript. Imagine you have a friend who can tell you what type of animal each of your pets is just by looking at them. That's what `typeof` does with variables.

### Primitive Data Types

In JavaScript, a primitive value is a single value that has no properties or methods. Think of them as different types of fruits in a fruit basket: each fruit is unique and has its own identity.

JavaScript has **7 primitive data types**:

- **string**: Text. Example: "apple"
- **number**: Numbers. Example: 42
- **boolean**: True or false. Example: true
- **bigint**: Large integers. Example: 123456789012345678901234567890n
- **symbol**: A unique identifier. Example: Symbol()
- **null**: Represents "nothing" or "empty." Example: null
- **undefined**: A variable that has not been defined. Example: undefined

The `typeof` operator returns the type of a variable or expression.

### Examples

```javascript
typeof "John"         // Returns "string"
typeof ("John" + "Doe") // Returns "string"
typeof 3.14           // Returns "number"
typeof 33             // Returns "number"
typeof (33 + 66)      // Returns "number"
typeof true           // Returns "boolean"
typeof false          // Returns "boolean"
typeof 1234n          // Returns "bigint"
typeof Symbol()       // Returns "symbol"
typeof x              // Returns "undefined"
typeof null           // Returns "object"
```

**Note**: In JavaScript, `null` is a primitive value. However, `typeof` returns "object." This is a well-known bug in JavaScript with historical reasons.

### Complex Data Types

A complex data type can store multiple values and/or different types of data together. You can think of this as a fruit salad, where each type of fruit can be different, but they are all together in a single bowl.

JavaScript has **one complex data type**:

- **object**: A container to store data in key-value pairs.

All other complex types, like arrays, functions, sets, and maps, are just different types of objects.

The `typeof` operator only returns two types for objects:

- **object**
- **function**

### Example

```javascript
typeof {name:'John'}   // Returns "object"
typeof [1, 2, 3, 4]     // Returns "object"
typeof new Map()       // Returns "object"
typeof new Set()       // Returns "object"
typeof function (){}   // Returns "function"
```

**Note**: The `typeof` operator returns "object" for all object types:

- objects
- arrays
- sets
- maps

You cannot use `typeof` to determine if an object in JavaScript is an array or a date.

### How to Recognize an Array

How can you tell if a variable is an array? 

ECMAScript 5 (2009) defined a new method for this: `Array.isArray()`.

### Example

```javascript
// Create an array
const fruits = ["apples", "bananas", "oranges"];
Array.isArray(fruits); // Returns true
```

### The `instanceof` Operator

The `instanceof` operator returns `true` if an object is an instance of a specified type of object. It's like your friend telling you whether the creature you have is a dog or a cat.

### Examples

```javascript
// Create a date
const time = new Date();
console.log(time instanceof Date); // Returns true

// Create an array
const fruits = ["apples", "bananas", "oranges"];
console.log(fruits instanceof Array); // Returns true

// Create a map
const fruitMap = new Map([
  ["apples", 500],
  ["bananas", 300],
  ["oranges", 200]
]);
console.log(fruitMap instanceof Map); // Returns true

// Create a set
const fruitSet = new Set(["apples", "bananas", "oranges"]);
console.log(fruitSet instanceof Set); // Returns true
```

### Undefined Variables

The `typeof` of an undefined variable is "undefined." 

### Example

```javascript
typeof car; // Returns "undefined"
```

The `typeof` of a variable without a value is also "undefined."

### Example

```javascript
let car;
typeof car; // Returns "undefined"
```

Any variable can be emptied by assigning it the value `undefined`.

### Example

```javascript
let car = "Volvo";
car = undefined; // Now the value is undefined
```

### Empty Values

An empty value has nothing to do with `undefined`. 

An empty string has both a legal value and a type.

### Example

```javascript
let car = "";
typeof car; // Returns "string"
```

### Null

In JavaScript, `null` means "nothing." It is supposed to represent something that does not exist. Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of `null` is an object.

You can empty an object by assigning it `null`.

### Example

```javascript
// Create an object
let person = {name: "John", surname: "Doe", age: 50, eyeColor: "blue"};
person = null; // Now the value is null, but the type remains "object"
```

You can also empty an object by assigning it `undefined`.

### Example

```javascript
let person = {name: "John", surname: "Doe", age: 50, eyeColor: "blue"};
person = undefined; // Now both the value and the type are "undefined"
```

### Difference Between Undefined and Null

`undefined` and `null` are equal in value, but different in type:

```javascript
typeof undefined      // "undefined"
typeof null           // "object"

null === undefined    // false
null == undefined     // true
```

### The Constructor Property

The `constructor` property returns the constructor function for all JavaScript variables.

### Example

```javascript
// Returns the Object() function:
{name:'John', age:34}.constructor

// Returns the Array() function:
[1,2,3,4].constructor

// Returns the Date() function:
new Date().constructor

// Returns the Set() function:
new Set().constructor

// Returns the Map() function:
new Map().constructor

// Returns the Function() function:
function () {}.constructor
```

With the constructor, you can check if an object is an array:

### Example

```javascript
(myArray.constructor === Array); // Returns true if it is an array
```

With the constructor, you can also check if an object is a date:

### Example

```javascript
(myDate.constructor === Date); // Returns true if it is a date
```

### All Together

```javascript
typeof "John"          // Returns "string"
typeof ("John" + "Doe") // Returns "string"
typeof 3.14            // Returns "number"
typeof (33 + 66)       // Returns "number"
typeof NaN             // Returns "number"
typeof 1234n           // Returns "bigint"
typeof true            // Returns "boolean"
typeof false           // Returns "boolean"
typeof {name:'John'}   // Returns "object"
typeof [1, 2, 3, 4]     // Returns "object"
typeof {}              // Returns "object"
typeof []              // Returns "object"
typeof new Object()    // Returns "object"
typeof new Array()     // Returns "object"
typeof new Date()      // Returns "object"
typeof new Set()       // Returns "object"
typeof new Map()       // Returns "object"
typeof function () {}  // Returns "function"
typeof x               // Returns "undefined"
typeof null            // Returns "object"
```

**Note**: The data type of `NaN` (Not a Number) is `number`!

### The `void` Operator

The `void` operator evaluates an expression and returns `undefined`. This operator is often used to obtain the primitive value `undefined`, using `void(0)` (useful when evaluating an expression without using the return value).

### Example

```html
<a href="javascript:void(0);">
  Useless link
</a>

<a href="javascript:void(document.body.style.backgroundColor='red');">
  Click here to change the background color to red
</a>
```

# JavaScript Type Conversion

JavaScript is a language that allows you to change the types of variables flexibly. This process is called **Type Conversion**. Imagine you have a set of Lego pieces. Some are squares, others are rectangles, and some are triangles. In JavaScript, you can transform those pieces (variables) into other shapes (data types) as needed. Here's how this works:

## Converting Strings to Numbers

The global function `Number()` converts a variable (or a value) into a number.

- A numeric string (like "3.14") is converted to a number (like 3.14).
- An empty string (like "") is converted to 0.
- A non-numeric string (like "John") is converted to NaN (Not a Number).

### Examples

These will convert:

```javascript
Number("3.14") // 3.14
Number(Math.PI) // 3.14159
Number(" ")    // 0
Number("")     // 0
```

These will not convert:

```javascript
Number("99 88") // NaN
Number("John")  // NaN
```

### Number Methods

In the Number Methods chapter, you'll find more methods that can be used to convert strings to numbers:

| Method         | Description                                    |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `Number()`     | Returns a number converted from its argument   |
| `parseFloat()` | Parses a string and returns a floating-point number |
| `parseInt()`   | Parses a string and returns an integer        |

### The Unary + Operator

The unary operator `+` can be used to convert a variable to a number.

#### Example

```javascript
let y = "5";      // y is a string
let x = +y;      // x is a number
```

If the variable cannot be converted, it will result in NaN:

```javascript
let y = "John";   // y is a string
let x = +y;      // x is a number (NaN)
```

## Converting Numbers to Strings

The global method `String()` can convert numbers to strings.

It can be used on any type of numbers, literals, variables, or expressions:

### Example

```javascript
String(x)         // returns a string of the numeric variable x
String(123)       // returns a string of the numeric literal 123
String(100 + 23)  // returns a string of the number from an expression
```

The `toString()` method of Number does the same.

### Example

```javascript
x.toString()        // converts x to a string
(123).toString()    // converts 123 to a string
(100 + 23).toString() // converts the result to a string
```

### More Methods

In the Number Methods chapter, you'll find more methods for converting numbers to strings:

| Method               | Description                                           |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `toExponential()`    | Returns a string, with a number rounded and written in exponential notation |
| `toFixed()`          | Returns a string, with a number rounded and written with a specified number of decimals |
| `toPrecision()`      | Returns a string, with a number written with a specified length |

## Converting Dates to Numbers

The global method `Number()` can also be used to convert dates to numbers.

```javascript
let d = new Date();
Number(d)          // returns 1404568027739
```

The `getTime()` method of Date does the same.

```javascript
let d = new Date();
d.getTime()        // returns 1404568027739
```

## Converting Dates to Strings

The global method `String()` can convert dates to strings.

```javascript
String(Date())  // returns "Thu Jul 17 2014 15:38:19 GMT+0200 (W. Europe Daylight Time)"
```

The `toString()` method of Date does the same.

### Example

```javascript
Date().toString()  // returns "Thu Jul 17 2014 15:38:19 GMT+0200 (W. Europe Daylight Time)"
```

### More Methods

In the Date Methods chapter, you'll find more methods for converting dates to strings:

| Method               | Description                                       |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `getDate()`          | Gets the day as a number (1-31)                  |
| `getDay()`           | Gets the day of the week as a number (0-6)       |
| `getFullYear()`      | Gets the year as a four-digit number (yyyy)      |
| `getHours()`         | Gets the hour (0-23)                              |
| `getMilliseconds()`   | Gets the milliseconds (0-999)                     |
| `getMinutes()`       | Gets the minutes (0-59)                           |
| `getMonth()`         | Gets the month (0-11)                            |
| `getSeconds()`       | Gets the seconds (0-59)                          |
| `getTime()`          | Gets the time (milliseconds since January 1, 1970) |

## Converting Booleans to Numbers

The global method `Number()` can also convert booleans to numbers.

```javascript
Number(false)     // returns 0
Number(true)      // returns 1
```

## Converting Booleans to Strings

The global method `String()` can convert booleans to strings.

```javascript
String(false)      // returns "false"
String(true)       // returns "true"
```

The `toString()` method of Boolean does the same.

```javascript
false.toString()   // returns "false"
true.toString()    // returns "true"
```

## Automatic Type Conversion

When JavaScript tries to operate with an "incorrect" data type, it attempts to convert the value to the "correct" type.

The result is not always what you expect:

```javascript
5 + null    // returns 5         because null is converted to 0
"5" + null  // returns "5null"   because null is converted to "null"
"5" + 2     // returns "52"      because 2 is converted to "2"
"5" - 2     // returns 3         because "5" is converted to 5
"5" * "2"   // returns 10        because "5" and "2" are converted to 5 and 2
```

## Automatic Conversion to String

JavaScript automatically calls the `toString()` function of a variable when you try to "output" an object or variable:

```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myVar;

// if myVar = {name:"Fjohn"}  // toString converts to "[object Object]"
// if myVar = [1,2,3,4]       // toString converts to "1,2,3,4"
// if myVar = new Date()      // toString converts to "Fri Jul 18 2014 09:08:55 GMT+0200"

// numbers and booleans are also converted, but this is not very visible:
// if myVar = 123             // toString converts to "123"
// if myVar = true            // toString converts to "true"
// if myVar = false           // toString converts to "false"
```

## Type Conversion Table in JavaScript

This table shows the result of converting different JavaScript values to Number, String, and Boolean:

| Original Value       | Converted to Number | Converted to String | Converted to Boolean |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| false                | 0                    | "false"              | false                  |
| true                 | 1                    | "true"               | true                   |
| 0                    | 0                    | "0"                  | false                  |
| 1                    | 1                    | "1"                  | true                   |
| "0"                  | 0                    | "0"                  | true                   |
| "000"                | 0                    | "000"                | true                   |
| "1"                  | 1                    | "1"                  | true                   |
| NaN                  | NaN                  | "NaN"                | false                  |
| Infinity             | Infinity             | "Infinity"           | true                   |
| -Infinity            | -Infinity            | "-Infinity"          | true                   |
| ""                   | 0                    | ""                   | false                  |
| "20"                 | 20                   | "20"                 | true                   |
| "twenty"             | NaN                  | "twenty"             | true                   |
| [ ]                  | 0                    | ""                   | true                   |
| [20]                 | 20                   | "20"                 | true                   |
| [10,20]             | NaN                  | "10,20"              | true                   |
| ["twenty"]          | NaN                  | "twenty"             | true                   |
| { }                  | NaN                  | "[object Object]"    | true                   |
| { x:20 }            | NaN                  | "[object Object]"    | true                   |

## Conclusion

Type conversion in JavaScript is a fundamental process that allows you to manipulate data flexibly and dynamically. Understanding how it works can help you avoid errors and write more efficient code. Keep exploring and practicing!

# JavaScript Destructuring

Destructuring is a powerful feature in JavaScript that allows you to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables. To illustrate this concept, consider the following analogies and examples.

## Destructuring Assignment Syntax

The destructuring assignment syntax allows us to extract values from objects or arrays and assign them to variables, making our code cleaner and more readable.

### Analogy: Unpacking a Box

Imagine you have a box with several compartments. Each compartment contains an object (or a value) that you want to use. Destructuring is like opening the box and taking the objects directly from each compartment without having to search for them one by one.

**Example of Object Destructuring:**

```javascript
// Create an object
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50
};

// Destructuring
let { firstName, lastName } = person;
```

**Note:** The order of properties does not matter:

```javascript
// Destructuring
let { lastName, firstName } = person;
```

> **Important Note:** Destructuring is not destructive; it does not change the original object.

## Default Values in Objects

Sometimes, a property might not exist on the object. To handle this, we can set default values.

### Analogy: A Surprise Party

Suppose you are organizing a surprise party, but some guests can't attend. You might plan for a "backup guest" to show up in their place.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Create an object
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50
};

// Destructuring with default value
let { firstName, lastName, country = "US" } = person;
```

## Object Property Aliasing

Sometimes, we want to rename properties when destructuring them.

### Analogy: Renaming a Product

Imagine you sell a product called "sunglasses," but in your store, you call it "summer accessory." When destructuring, you can give the property a new name.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Create an object
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50
};

// Destructuring with alias
let { lastName: name } = person;
```

## String Destructuring

Destructuring can also be used to unpack characters from strings.

### Analogy: Separating Letters from a Name

Imagine you have a bag of letters and you want to take some out to form a name.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Create a string
let name = "W3Schools";

// Destructuring
let [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5] = name;
```

## Array Destructuring

We can extract values from arrays and assign them to our own variables.

### Analogy: Picking Fruits from a Basket

If you have a basket full of fruits, you can select some directly.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Create an array
const fruits = ["Bananas", "Oranges", "Apples", "Mangos"];

// Destructuring
let [fruit1, fruit2] = fruits;
```

### Skipping Array Values

If you want to skip some values, you can use commas.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Create an array
const fruits = ["Bananas", "Oranges", "Apples", "Mangos"];

// Destructuring
let [fruit1, , , fruit2] = fruits;
```

### Position-Based Values in Arrays

You can select values from specific index locations in the array.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Create an array
const fruits = ["Bananas", "Oranges", "Apples", "Mangos"];

// Destructuring
let { [0]: fruit1, [1]: fruit2 } = fruits;
```

## The Rest Property

You can end a destructuring syntax with a rest property, which stores all remaining values into a new array.

### Analogy: Grouping Everything Leftover

Imagine at the end of a party, you decide to group all leftover toys into one box.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Create an array
const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70];

// Destructuring
const [a, b, ...rest] = numbers;
```

## Destructuring Maps

You can also use destructuring with `Map` objects.

### Analogy: A Restaurant Menu

Imagine a menu where each dish has a price. You can iterate over the menu and extract the names and prices of the dishes.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Create a Map
const fruits = new Map([
  ["apples", 500],
  ["bananas", 300],
  ["oranges", 200]
]);

// Destructuring
let text = "";
for (const [key, value] of fruits) {
  text += key + " is " + value + "\n";
}
```

## Swapping JavaScript Variables

You can swap the values of two variables using a destructuring assignment.

### Analogy: Changing Clothes

If you decide to swap t-shirts with a friend, you simply take them off and give them to each other.

**Example:**

```javascript
let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Doe";

// Destructuring
[firstName, lastName] = [lastName, firstName];
```

# JavaScript Bitwise Operations

## Introduction

Bitwise operations in JavaScript allow you to manipulate individual bits of binary numbers directly. To understand this better, imagine that numbers are like rows of tiny light bulbs (bits), where each light bulb can either be on (1) or off (0). Bitwise operators are like switches that control how these bulbs interact with each other. Let's explore these operations using simple analogies!

---

## JavaScript Bitwise Operators

| Operator | Name                        | Description                                                                 |
|----------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `&`      | AND                         | Turns the light bulb on (1) only if both corresponding bulbs are on (1)     |
| `|`      | OR                          | Turns the light bulb on (1) if at least one of the corresponding bulbs is on |
| `^`      | XOR                         | Turns the light bulb on (1) if only one of the corresponding bulbs is on     |
| `~`      | NOT                         | Flips all the bulbs (1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 1)                              |
| `<<`     | Zero fill left shift         | Shifts all the bulbs to the left, filling in new bulbs on the right with 0   |
| `>>`     | Signed right shift           | Shifts all the bulbs to the right, preserving the sign (leftmost bit)        |
| `>>>`    | Zero fill right shift        | Shifts all the bulbs to the right, filling in new bulbs on the left with 0   |

---

### Example 1: Bitwise AND (`&`)
- **Analogy**: Imagine you have two rows of bulbs. The `&` operator will only turn on a bulb in the final row if both bulbs in the same position are on in the original rows.
  
#### Operation: `5 & 1`
- Binary of 5: `0101`
- Binary of 1: `0001`
- Result: `0001` (Decimal: 1)

```javascript
let result = 5 & 1; // result = 1
```

---

### Example 2: Bitwise OR (`|`)
- **Analogy**: If at least one of the two bulbs in the original rows is on, the `|` operator will turn on the corresponding bulb in the final row.

#### Operation: `5 | 1`
- Binary of 5: `0101`
- Binary of 1: `0001`
- Result: `0101` (Decimal: 5)

```javascript
let result = 5 | 1; // result = 5
```

---

### Example 3: Bitwise XOR (`^`)
- **Analogy**: The XOR operator checks each position. If the bulbs are different (one is on and the other is off), it will turn on the bulb in the final row. If both are the same (both on or both off), it turns the bulb off.

#### Operation: `5 ^ 1`
- Binary of 5: `0101`
- Binary of 1: `0001`
- Result: `0100` (Decimal: 4)

```javascript
let result = 5 ^ 1; // result = 4
```

---

### Example 4: Bitwise NOT (`~`)
- **Analogy**: Think of the NOT operator as a switch that flips every bulb. If the bulb is on, it turns off, and if it‚Äôs off, it turns on.

#### Operation: `~5`
- Binary of 5: `00000000000000000000000000000101`
- Result (flipped): `11111111111111111111111111111010` (Decimal: -6)

```javascript
let result = ~5; // result = -6
```

---

### Example 5: Left Shift (`<<`)
- **Analogy**: Shifting the bulbs to the left means the row of bulbs moves over, and new bulbs on the right are added and always turned off (0).

#### Operation: `5 << 1`
- Binary of 5: `0101`
- Result (shifted left): `1010` (Decimal: 10)

```javascript
let result = 5 << 1; // result = 10
```

---

### Example 6: Signed Right Shift (`>>`)
- **Analogy**: Shifting bulbs to the right means the row of bulbs moves over to the right, and the leftmost bulb (which is the sign bit) is duplicated to fill in the gap.

#### Operation: `-5 >> 1`
- Binary of -5: `11111111111111111111111111111011`
- Result: `11111111111111111111111111111101` (Decimal: -3)

```javascript
let result = -5 >> 1; // result = -3
```

---

### Example 7: Zero Fill Right Shift (`>>>`)
- **Analogy**: Like the right shift, but instead of duplicating the leftmost bulb, it fills in the left side with off bulbs (0).

#### Operation: `5 >>> 1`
- Binary of 5: `00000000000000000000000000000101`
- Result: `00000000000000000000000000000010` (Decimal: 2)

```javascript
let result = 5 >>> 1; // result = 2
```

---

## Binary Numbers

Binary numbers are like a sequence of light bulbs that represent values. Each bulb corresponds to a specific power of two. For example:

- `0001` = 1
- `0010` = 2
- `0100` = 4
- `1000` = 8

If more bulbs are turned on, the value becomes a sum of the powers of two. For example, `0101` = 5 (4 + 1).

---

## Fun Binary Joke

There are only 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary and those who don‚Äôt!

---

## Converting Decimal to Binary

You can easily convert a decimal number to its binary representation using JavaScript:

```javascript
function dec2bin(dec) {
  return (dec >>> 0).toString(2);
}

console.log(dec2bin(5)); // Output: "101"
```

This function shifts the number to the right and converts it to binary.

---

## Conclusion

Bitwise operations may seem complicated, but with simple analogies and understanding the rules of binary, they become much easier to grasp. Think of bitwise operators as tiny switches controlling light bulbs, and you're on your way to mastering them!

# JavaScript Regular Expressions

## Introduction

**Regular expressions** are sequences of characters that form a search pattern. This pattern can be used for text search or text replacement.

### What is a Regular Expression?

Imagine you're looking for a number in a big book. Regular expressions are like magical glasses that allow you to see only the numbers, ignoring everything else. They can be as simple as searching for a single character or as complex as defining advanced patterns to find exactly what you need.

In summary:
- A regular expression can be a single character or a more elaborate pattern.
- They are used to perform searches or text replacements in strings.

---

## Regular Expression Syntax

The basic syntax is:

```
/pattern/modifiers;
```

### Example:

```javascript
/w3schools/i;
```

#### Explanation of the Example:

- `/w3schools/` is a **regular expression**.
- `w3schools` is the **pattern** (what you're searching for).
- `i` is a **modifier** that makes the search **case-insensitive**.

---

## Using String Methods with Regular Expressions

In JavaScript, regular expressions are often used with the `search()` and `replace()` string methods.

### The `search()` Method
The `search()` method uses an expression to find a match and returns the position where it was found.

#### Example:

```javascript
let text = "Visit W3Schools!";
let n = text.search("W3Schools");
```

In this case, the search will return `6`, which is the position where "W3Schools" starts in the string.

### The `replace()` Method
The `replace()` method returns a new string where the pattern found is replaced.

#### Example:

```javascript
let text = "Visit Microsoft!";
let result = text.replace("Microsoft", "W3Schools");
```

This code replaces "Microsoft" with "W3Schools", returning "Visit W3Schools!".

---

## Using `search()` with Regular Expressions

When using regular expressions instead of plain strings, you can make more advanced searches. For example, you can search regardless of uppercase or lowercase letters.

#### Example:

```javascript
let text = "Visit W3Schools";
let n = text.search(/w3schools/i);
```

Here, we're searching for "w3schools" in a case-insensitive way. The result will still be `6`.

---

## Using `replace()` with Regular Expressions

You can also use regular expressions in the `replace()` method to replace text in a more flexible way.

#### Example:

```javascript
let text = "Visit Microsoft!";
let result = text.replace(/microsoft/i, "W3Schools");
```

Here, we're replacing "Microsoft" with "W3Schools" regardless of case. The result will be "Visit W3Schools!".

---

## Regular Expression Modifiers

**Modifiers** are like small additional instructions that tell the regular expression how to search.

| Modifier  | Description                                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `i`       | Case-insensitive matching                        |
| `g`       | Global search (find all matches)                 |
| `m`       | Multiline search                                 |
| `d`       | Start and end match (New in ES2022)              |

---

## Regular Expression Patterns

Patterns define what you're specifically searching for. Here are some common examples:

### Using Brackets `[]`

Brackets are used to find any character within a range.

| Expression   | Description                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `[abc]`      | Find any of the characters between the brackets   |
| `[0-9]`      | Find any digit between 0 and 9                    |
| `(x|y)`      | Find any of the alternatives separated by `|`     |

### Using Metacharacters

**Metacharacters** are special characters with unique meanings.

| Metacharacter | Description                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `\d`          | Find a digit                                     |
| `\s`          | Find a whitespace character                      |
| `\b`          | Find a match at the beginning or end of a word   |

### Using Quantifiers

**Quantifiers** define how many times a character should appear in a match.

| Quantifier    | Description                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `n+`          | Matches any string containing at least one `n`   |
| `n*`          | Matches any string containing zero or more occurrences of `n` |
| `n?`          | Matches any string containing zero or one occurrence of `n`    |

---

## The RegExp Object in JavaScript

The **RegExp object** is a predefined object in JavaScript used to work with regular expressions.

### Using `test()`

The `test()` method searches for a pattern in a string and returns `true` or `false`, depending on whether it finds a match.

#### Example:

```javascript
const pattern = /e/;
console.log(pattern.test("The best things in life are free!")); // true
```

Since the letter "e" is in the string, the result will be `true`.

### Using `exec()`

The `exec()` method searches for a pattern in a string and returns the matched text as an object. If no match is found, it returns `null`.

#### Example:

```javascript
/e/.exec("The best things in life are free!");
```

This code will search for the letter "e" and return the first match found.

---

## Conclusion

Regular expressions are a powerful tool in JavaScript for searching and replacing text. Although they may seem complex at first, with practice and using simple analogies like magical glasses that filter what you're looking for, we can learn to handle them and make the most of their potential.

# JavaScript Operator Precedence

## Introduction

**Operator precedence** in JavaScript describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression. Understanding this concept is essential to ensure your code behaves as expected. A good way to think about it is to imagine that you are tackling a list of tasks in a certain order: some tasks are more urgent than others, so you have to do those first.

## Analogy: Solving Tasks in Order

Think of operator precedence like a to-do list. For example, if you have to multiply and add several numbers, it‚Äôs like having a list of things to do. Multiplication is an urgent task, while addition is less urgent. Therefore, multiplication is done first, regardless of the order it appears in!

In code:

```javascript
let x = 100 + 50 * 3;
```

Here, even though `100 + 50` comes first, `50 * 3` is solved first because multiplication has higher priority. Then, we add the result to 100, which gives us `250`.

### Grouping with Parentheses

Now, if you want addition to happen first, you can use parentheses, as if saying, ‚Äúdo this first, because it‚Äôs more important.‚Äù

```javascript
let x = (100 + 50) * 3;
```

With the parentheses, we‚Äôre telling JavaScript to add `100 + 50` first and then multiply the result by 3. Now, the result is `450`.

---

## Operator Precedence Rules

### Operators with the Same Precedence

If two operators have the same precedence, like multiplication (`*`) and division (`/`), they are solved from left to right, just like you would read a book.

For example:

```javascript
let x = 100 / 50 * 3;
```

First, `100 / 50` is solved, which gives `2`, and then we multiply it by `3`, giving `6`.

---

## Operator Precedence Values

Below is a list of the most important operators and their precedence level, from highest to lowest. The higher the number, the more urgent (or prioritized) the operator is:

### Expression Grouping

The operator with the highest precedence is **parentheses** `()`, which groups operations and tells JavaScript to solve them first.

| Precedence | Operator      | Description                     | Example              |
|------------|---------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| 18         | `()`          | Expression Grouping              | `(100 + 50) * 3`     |

### Accessing Properties

When accessing object properties, whether using dot notation (`.`) or brackets (`[]`), these operators have high precedence because they need to execute before you can work with the value.

| Precedence | Operator      | Description                     | Example              |
|------------|---------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| 17         | `.`           | Access a property                | `person.name`        |
| 17         | `[]`          | Access a property                | `person["name"]`     |

### Increment and Decrement Operators

The **postfix version** (when the operator is after the variable, like `i++`) has higher precedence than the **prefix version** (when the operator comes first, like `++i`).

| Precedence | Operator      | Description                     | Example              |
|------------|---------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| 15         | `i++`         | Postfix increment                | `i++`                |
| 14         | `++i`         | Prefix increment                 | `++i`                |

### Logical and Unary Operators

Unary operators, such as **logical NOT** (`!`) and **bitwise NOT** (`~`), have relatively high precedence. These operators change the value of a variable without needing other operands.

| Precedence | Operator      | Description                     | Example              |
|------------|---------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| 14         | `!`           | Logical NOT                      | `!(x == y)`          |
| 14         | `~`           | Bitwise NOT                      | `~x`                 |

### Arithmetic Operators

**Exponentiation** (`**`) has higher precedence than multiplication (`*`) or division (`/`). These, in turn, have higher precedence than addition (`+`) or subtraction (`-`).

| Precedence | Operator      | Description                     | Example              |
|------------|---------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| 13         | `**`          | Exponentiation                   | `10 ** 2`            |
| 12         | `*`           | Multiplication                   | `10 * 5`             |
| 12         | `/`           | Division                         | `10 / 5`             |
| 11         | `+`           | Addition                         | `10 + 5`             |
| 11         | `-`           | Subtraction                      | `10 - 5`             |

---

## Conclusion

Operator precedence may seem complex at first, but the key is to remember that some operators, like multiplication and division, are more urgent than addition and subtraction. When in doubt, use parentheses to make sure the operation you want is executed first.

And that‚Äôs it! Now you have a clear guide on how operator precedence affects your calculations in JavaScript, using a simple analogy to make it easier to remember. üöÄ

# JavaScript Errors: `Throw`, `Try...Catch...Finally`

### Understanding Errors with Simple Analogies

Imagine you're trying to bake a cake. You follow a recipe, but there are some mistakes along the way. Maybe you accidentally add salt instead of sugar (an **error**). You could choose to ignore it and bake the cake anyway, but it won't turn out well! To prevent this, you set up some rules: if you notice the mistake early, you‚Äôll stop and fix it, or handle the problem somehow.

JavaScript works similarly when it runs code. It expects everything to go smoothly, but **errors** can happen. Sometimes we can predict and handle these errors using `try...catch...finally`.

---

### `try`: Baking the Cake (Running the Code)

The `try` block is like following the recipe. You attempt to bake the cake (run the code) step by step.

```js
try {
  // Try to follow the recipe (execute code)
}
```

---

### `catch`: Handling the Salt Mistake (Catching Errors)

If something goes wrong‚Äîlike realizing you added salt instead of sugar‚Äîthis is where `catch` comes in. You can decide how to handle the error, like starting over or fixing it.

```js
catch (err) {
  // Handle the mistake (handle the error)
}
```

---

### `finally`: Clean Up After Baking (Code that Always Runs)

Regardless of whether the cake turned out well or not, you‚Äôll clean up the kitchen afterward. This is what `finally` does: it always runs, whether there was an error or not.

```js
finally {
  // Clean up after baking (code that always runs)
}
```

---

### Custom Errors with `throw`: Creating Your Own "Recipe Alert"

In some cases, you might want to deliberately stop the process if you know something is wrong, like running out of flour. With `throw`, you can create your own custom errors. It's like saying, "Stop! We can't continue without flour."

```js
throw "Out of flour"; // Custom error
```

---

### Example: The Cake Recipe (Try, Catch, Finally in Action)

Let‚Äôs look at a simple example where we try to run some code, but handle any errors that come up:

```html
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
try {
  adddlert("Welcome guest!"); // This will cause an error
}
catch (err) {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = err.message; // Handle the error
}
finally {
  // Code that will run no matter what
}
</script>
```

Here, we deliberately made a typo with `adddlert` instead of `alert`. When JavaScript encounters this error, it ‚Äúcatches‚Äù it in the `catch` block and displays the error message.

---

### JavaScript Throws Errors

When JavaScript runs into an error, it "throws" an error message, like when you realize there‚Äôs a mistake in your recipe. It stops what it's doing and raises the alert.

JavaScript creates an **Error Object** with two important properties:
1. `name`: The type of error (e.g., SyntaxError, TypeError).
2. `message`: A description of the error.

---

### Using `throw` to Create Custom Errors

The `throw` statement is like creating your own emergency stop in a recipe. You can stop the process with your own error message. It can be a string, a number, or even an object.

```js
throw "Too many ingredients!";
throw 500;  // You can throw numbers too
```

---

### Example: Input Validation

Here's an example where we check if someone‚Äôs input is a valid number between 5 and 10. If it‚Äôs not, we throw a custom error:

```html
<p>Please input a number between 5 and 10:</p>

<input id="demo" type="text">
<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Test Input</button>
<p id="p01"></p>

<script>
function myFunction() {
  const message = document.getElementById("p01");
  message.innerHTML = "";
  let x = document.getElementById("demo").value;
  try {
    if (x.trim() == "") throw "empty";
    if (isNaN(x)) throw "not a number";
    x = Number(x);
    if (x < 5) throw "too low";
    if (x > 10) throw "too high";
  }
  catch (err) {
    message.innerHTML = "Input is " + err;
  }
}
</script>
```

Here, the user inputs a number. If the input is incorrect (e.g., empty, not a number, too low, or too high), we throw custom error messages, which are then caught and displayed.

---

### The `finally` Statement: Always Cleaning Up

The `finally` block ensures that certain code runs no matter what, even if there's an error. For example, resetting the input field after checking the value.

```js
finally {
  document.getElementById("demo").value = ""; // Clear the input field no matter what
}
```

---

### JavaScript Error Object

JavaScript has built-in error types, which come with specific names and messages. Here are the most common ones:

- **EvalError**: Issues in the `eval()` function.
- **RangeError**: A number that is out of range (e.g., asking for 500 decimal places).
- **ReferenceError**: Referring to a variable that hasn‚Äôt been declared.
- **SyntaxError**: Incorrect syntax, like missing quotes or parentheses.
- **TypeError**: A mismatch between the type expected and the type provided (e.g., trying to call a method on a number).
- **URIError**: Issues with URI encoding/decoding.

---

### Example of Common Errors

#### **RangeError**
```js
let num = 1;
try {
  num.toPrecision(500); // 500 is too many decimal places
}
catch (err) {
  console.log(err.name); // RangeError
}
```

#### **ReferenceError**
```js
try {
  x = y + 1; // y is not declared
}
catch (err) {
  console.log(err.name); // ReferenceError
}
```

#### **SyntaxError**
```js
try {
  eval("alert('Hello)"); // Missing closing quote
}
catch (err) {
  console.log(err.name); // SyntaxError
}
```

#### **TypeError**
```js
let num = 1;
try {
  num.toUpperCase(); // Can't apply toUpperCase on a number
}
catch (err) {
  console.log(err.name); // TypeError
}
```

#### **URIError**
```js
try {
  decodeURI("%%%"); // Invalid URI characters
}
catch (err) {
  console.log(err.name); // URIError
}
```

---

### Conclusion

Handling errors in JavaScript is like troubleshooting during a recipe. By using `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `throw`, you can anticipate and handle problems gracefully, ensuring your code continues to function smoothly, even when unexpected issues arise.

# JavaScript Scope

**Scope** determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables in JavaScript.

JavaScript has 3 types of scope:

- **Block Scope**
- **Function Scope**
- **Global Scope**

## Block Scope

Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript only had Global Scope and Function Scope.

ES6 introduced two important keywords: `let` and `const`.

These two keywords provide **Block Scope** in JavaScript. Variables declared inside a block `{ }` cannot be accessed from outside the block.

### Example

```javascript
{
  let x = 2;
}
// x CANNOT be used here
```

Variables declared with the `var` keyword do NOT have block scope. Variables declared inside a block `{ }` can be accessed from outside the block.

### Example

```javascript
{
  var x = 2;
}
// x CAN be used here
```

**Analogy**: Imagine you have a box (the block). If you close the box and put a toy inside, you cannot access that toy from outside. But if you leave a toy on the floor (using `var`), you can access it from anywhere in the room.

---

## Local Scope

Variables declared within a JavaScript function are **local** to that function.

### Example

```javascript
// This code CANNOT use carName

function myFunction() {
  let carName = "Volvo";
  // This code CAN use carName
}

// This code CANNOT use carName
```

Local variables have **Function Scope**. They can only be accessed from within the function.

Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions.

Local variables are created when a function starts and deleted when the function completes.

**Analogy**: Think of a party. Each room has its own games (variables). If you leave a game in the living room (outside the function), everyone can play with it, but if you put it in a bedroom (inside the function), only those in that room can use it.

---

## Function Scope

JavaScript has **function scope**: each function creates a new scope. Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.

Variables declared with `var`, `let`, and `const` are quite similar when declared inside a function; they all have Function Scope.

### Example

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  var carName = "Volvo";   // Function Scope
}
function myFunction() {
  let carName = "Volvo";   // Function Scope
}
function myFunction() {
  const carName = "Volvo"; // Function Scope
}
```

---

## Global Variables in JavaScript

A variable declared outside of a function becomes **GLOBAL**.

### Example

```javascript
let carName = "Volvo";
// This code can use carName

function myFunction() {
  // This code can also use carName
}
```

A global variable has **Global Scope**: all scripts and functions on a webpage can access it.

Variables declared with `var`, `let`, and `const` are similar when declared outside a block; they all have Global Scope.

### Example

```javascript
var x = 2;       // Global scope
let x = 2;       // Global scope
const x = 2;     // Global scope
```

**Analogy**: Imagine a cat's name written on a whiteboard in the center of a room (the global scope). Everyone in the room can see and use that name, no matter what corner of the room they are in.

---

## Automatically Global Variables

If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a **GLOBAL** variable.

### Example

```javascript
myFunction();

// This code can use carName

function myFunction() {
  carName = "Volvo"; // Becomes a global variable
}
```

### Strict Mode

All modern browsers support running JavaScript in **"Strict Mode"**. In this mode, undeclared variables are not automatically global.

---

## Global Variables in HTML

With JavaScript, the global scope is the JavaScript environment. In HTML, the global scope is the `window` object.

Global variables defined with the `var` keyword belong to the `window` object:

### Example

```javascript
var carName = "Volvo";
// This code can use window.carName
```

Global variables defined with the `let` keyword do not belong to the `window` object:

### Example

```javascript
let carName = "Volvo";
// This code CANNOT use window.carName
```

### Warning

**Do NOT create global variables unless you intend to!** Your global variables (or functions) can overwrite window variables (or functions). 

Any function, including the `window` object, can overwrite your global variables and functions.

---

## The Lifetime of JavaScript Variables

The lifetime of a JavaScript variable starts when it is declared.

Function (local) variables are deleted when the function is completed. In a web browser, global variables are deleted when you close the browser window (or tab).

### Function Arguments

Function arguments (parameters) work as local variables inside functions.

---

# JavaScript Hoisting

### What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope. Imagine a teacher organizing students' desks at the start of the school year. Even if students sit down at their desks first, the teacher ensures that each desk has a nameplate at the top for the respective student. This way, even if a student arrives late, their name is already at their desk.

### JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted
In JavaScript, a variable can be used before it has been declared. 

**Example 1:**
```javascript
x = 5; // Assign 5 to x
elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element
elem.innerHTML = x; // Display x in the element
var x; // Declare x
```

**Example 2:**
```javascript
var x; // Declare x
x = 5; // Assign 5 to x
elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element
elem.innerHTML = x; // Display x in the element
```

Both examples produce the same result. In other words, JavaScript lifts the declaration of `x` to the top, much like how the teacher organizes the nameplates first.

### The let and const Keywords
Variables defined with `let` and `const` are hoisted to the top of the block, but they are not initialized. Think of it as placing the students' nameplates on their desks without assigning them to a particular student yet. The desk is ready, but the student cannot be recognized until they arrive.

Using a `let` variable before it is declared results in a `ReferenceError`, indicating that the variable exists but has not yet been defined:

**Example:**
```javascript
carName = "Volvo"; // ReferenceError
let carName;
```

Similarly, using a `const` variable before it is declared causes a syntax error. The code will simply not run:

**Example:**
```javascript
carName = "Volvo"; // SyntaxError
const carName;
```

### JavaScript Initializations are Not Hoisted
JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations. This means that the variable `y` is declared but not initialized before it is used, resulting in `undefined`.

**Example 1:**
```javascript
var x = 5; // Initialize x
var y = 7; // Initialize y
elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element
elem.innerHTML = x + " " + y; // Display x and y
```

**Example 2:**
```javascript
var x = 5; // Initialize x
elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element
elem.innerHTML = x + " " + y; // Display x and y
var y = 7; // Initialize y
```

In the second example, `y` is `undefined` because only its declaration was hoisted to the top, similar to a student being present in class but without their assignment being completed yet.

### Declare Your Variables At the Top!
Hoisting can lead to bugs if not understood properly. To avoid confusion and errors, it's a good practice to always declare all variables at the beginning of every scope. This is like ensuring all students are seated and have their nameplates organized before starting class. In strict mode, JavaScript does not allow the use of undeclared variables.

# JavaScript Use Strict

### What is "use strict"?
The `"use strict";` directive tells JavaScript to run the code in strict mode. Think of this as a set of rules for a game that ensures everyone plays fairly. Strict mode helps catch common coding mistakes and "bad syntax" by throwing errors when they occur.

### Declaring Strict Mode
You can declare strict mode by adding `"use strict";` at the beginning of your script or function. 

**Example:**
```javascript
"use strict";
x = 3.14; // This will cause an error because x is not declared
```

If strict mode is declared inside a function, it only affects that function:

**Example:**
```javascript
function myFunction() {
  "use strict";
  y = 3.14; // This will cause an error
}
myFunction();
```

### Why Use Strict Mode?
Strict mode helps prevent the accidental creation of global variables and improves the overall quality of the code. For example, if you mistype a variable name, it will throw an error in strict mode instead of creating a new global variable.

### Not Allowed in Strict Mode
In strict mode, the following actions are not allowed:

- Using undeclared variables:
    ```javascript
    "use strict";
    x = 3.14; // Error
    ```

- Deleting variables:
    ```javascript
    "use strict";
    let x = 3.14;
    delete x; // Error
    ```

- Duplicating parameter names:
    ```javascript
    "use strict";
    function x(p1, p1) {}; // Error
    ```

- Using `eval` and `with` statements improperly, and other restrictions related to variable names.

### Future Proof!
Strict mode also prevents the use of future reserved keywords as variable names. For instance, the following code will cause an error:

```javascript
"use strict";
let public = 1500; // Error
```

### Conclusion
Using `"use strict";` and understanding hoisting are fundamental in writing clean, bug-free JavaScript code. Always declare your variables at the top and utilize strict mode to enforce better coding practices!

# Understanding JavaScript Concepts: `this` Keyword and Arrow Functions

## The JavaScript `this` Keyword

### Example
```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  id: 5566,
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};
```

### What is `this`?
In JavaScript, the `this` keyword refers to an object, but its meaning changes based on the context in which it is used. Think of `this` as a "contextual pointer" that indicates which object you are currently working with. Here‚Äôs how `this` behaves in different scenarios:

1. **In an object method:** `this` refers to the object itself.
2. **Alone:** `this` refers to the global object (e.g., `window` in browsers).
3. **In a function:** `this` refers to the global object.
4. **In a strict mode function:** `this` is `undefined`.
5. **In an event:** `this` refers to the element that triggered the event.
6. **Using `call()`, `apply()`, or `bind()`:** You can explicitly set what `this` refers to.

### Note
`this` is a keyword, not a variable. You cannot change its value directly.

### `this` in a Method
When used in an object method, `this` points to the object that the method belongs to. For instance, in the `person` object, calling `fullName()` returns `John Doe` because `this` refers to the `person` object.

### `this` Alone
When `this` is used alone, it refers to the global object. In a browser, the global object is represented as `[object Window]`.

**Example**
```javascript
let x = this; // x is the global object
```

In strict mode, `this` still refers to the global object, but in a stricter sense.

**Example**
```javascript
"use strict";
let x = this; // x is undefined
```

### `this` in a Function (Default)
By default, in a regular function, `this` refers to the global object.

**Example**
```javascript
function myFunction() {
  return this; // Returns the global object
}
```

### `this` in a Function (Strict)
In strict mode, `this` will be `undefined` within a regular function, preventing unintentional global variable creation.

**Example**
```javascript
"use strict";
function myFunction() {
  return this; // Returns undefined
}
```

### `this` in Event Handlers
In HTML event handlers, `this` refers to the HTML element that received the event.

**Example**
```html
<button onclick="this.style.display='none'">
  Click to Remove Me!
</button>
```

### Object Method Binding
In these examples, `this` is still the `person` object.

**Example**
```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  id: 5566,
  myFunction: function() {
    return this; // Refers to the person object
  }
};
```

### Explicit Function Binding
The `call()` and `apply()` methods allow you to specify which object `this` refers to.

**Example**
```javascript
const person1 = {
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
}

const person2 = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
}

// Returns "John Doe":
person1.fullName.call(person2); // person2 is now the context
```

### Function Borrowing
With the `bind()` method, an object can borrow a method from another object.

**Example**
```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
}

const member = {
  firstName: "Hege",
  lastName: "Nilsen",
}

let fullName = person.fullName.bind(member); // member borrows fullName
```

### Precedence of `this`
To determine which object `this` refers to, follow this precedence:

1. `bind()`
2. `apply()` and `call()`
3. Object method
4. Global scope

# JavaScript Arrow Function

Arrow functions were introduced in ES6 to provide a shorter syntax for writing functions.

### Shorter Syntax
```javascript
let myFunction = (a, b) => a * b; // Shortened function syntax
```

### Before Arrow Functions
```javascript
hello = function() {
  return "Hello World!";
}
```

### With Arrow Function
```javascript
hello = () => {
  return "Hello World!";
}
```

If the function has only one statement, and the statement returns a value, you can omit the brackets and the `return` keyword.

### Arrow Functions Return Value by Default
```javascript
hello = () => "Hello World!"; // Returns value by default
```

### Arrow Function With Parameters
When using parameters, you include them within parentheses:
```javascript
hello = (val) => "Hello " + val;
```

If you have only one parameter, you can even omit the parentheses:
```javascript
hello = val => "Hello " + val;
```

### What About `this`?
Arrow functions handle `this` differently than regular functions. In arrow functions, there is **no binding of `this`**. Instead, `this` retains the value of the enclosing lexical context.

### Example: Regular Function vs Arrow Function
Both examples below call a method twice, but with different outcomes for `this`.

#### Regular Function:
```javascript
hello = function() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += this;
}

window.addEventListener("load", hello); // `this` refers to the window
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", hello); // `this` refers to the button
```

#### Arrow Function:
```javascript
hello = () => {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += this; // `this` is the owner (window)
}

window.addEventListener("load", hello); // `this` still refers to the window
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", hello); // `this` still refers to the window
```

### Remember these differences when working with functions. Sometimes the behavior of regular functions is what you want, if not, consider using arrow functions.

### Browser Support
The following table defines the first browser versions with full support for Arrow Functions in JavaScript:

| Browser  | Version | Release Date  |

# JavaScript Classes

### Introduction to Classes
ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, introduced JavaScript Classes.

JavaScript Classes are templates for JavaScript Objects. Think of a class as a blueprint for building a house: the blueprint tells you how the house should be, but it is not the house itself.

### JavaScript Class Syntax
To create a class, use the `class` keyword. Always add a method named `constructor()`.

#### Syntax
```javascript
class ClassName {
  constructor() { ... }
}
```

### Example
```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(name, year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
  }
}
```
The example above creates a class called `Car`. The class has two initial properties: `name` and `year`.

Remember: a class itself is not an object; it is a template for creating objects.

### Using a Class
When you have a class, you can use it to create objects:

#### Example
```javascript
const myCar1 = new Car("Ford", 2014);
const myCar2 = new Car("Audi", 2019);
```
In this example, we use the `Car` class to create two `Car` objects. The `constructor` method is called automatically when a new object is created.

### The Constructor Method
The constructor method is a special method:
- It must have the exact name "constructor".
- It runs automatically when a new object is created.
- It is used to initialize the object's properties.

If you do not define a constructor method, JavaScript will add an empty constructor method by default.

### Class Methods
Class methods are created with the same syntax as object methods.

#### Syntax
```javascript
class ClassName {
  constructor() { ... }
  method_1() { ... }
  method_2() { ... }
  method_3() { ... }
}
```

#### Example of a Class Method
Create a class method named `age`, which returns the car's age:

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(name, year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
  }
  age() {
    const date = new Date();
    return date.getFullYear() - this.year;
  }
}

const myCar = new Car("Ford", 2014);
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"My car is " + myCar.age() + " years old.";
```

### Sending Parameters to Class Methods
You can send parameters to class methods:

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(name, year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
  }
  age(x) {
    return x - this.year;
  }
}

const date = new Date();
let year = date.getFullYear();

const myCar = new Car("Ford", 2014);
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML=
"My car is " + myCar.age(year) + " years old.";
```

### Browser Support
The following table defines the first browser version with full support for Classes in JavaScript:

| Browser   | Version | Release Date         |

# JavaScript Modules

### Introduction to Modules
JavaScript modules allow you to break up your code into separate files. This makes it easier to maintain a codebase. Think of modules as compartments in a wardrobe: each compartment (module) holds different things, but they all form part of the same wardrobe (the application).

### Importing Modules
Modules are imported from external files with the `import` statement. Additionally, modules rely on `type="module"` in the `<script>` tag.

#### Example
```html
<script type="module">
import message from "./message.js";
</script>
```

### Exporting
Modules with functions or variables can be stored in any external file. There are two types of exports: **Named Exports** and **Default Exports**.

#### Named Exports
Let‚Äôs create a file named `person.js` and fill it with the things we want to export. You can create named exports in two ways: inline individually or all at once at the bottom.

- **Inline Individually:**
```javascript
// person.js
export const name = "Jesse";
export const age = 40;
```

- **All at Once at the Bottom:**
```javascript
// person.js
const name = "Jesse";
const age = 40;

export { name, age };
```

#### Default Exports
Let‚Äôs create another file named `message.js` and use it to demonstrate the default export. You can only have one default export in a file.

#### Example
```javascript
// message.js
const message = () => {
  const name = "Jesse";
  const age = 40;
  return name + ' is ' + age + ' years old.';
};

export default message;
```

### Importing Modules
You can import modules into a file in two ways, based on whether they are named exports or default exports.

- **Importing from Named Exports**
```javascript
import { name, age } from "./person.js";
```

- **Importing from Default Exports**
```javascript
import message from "./message.js";
```

### Note
Modules only work with the HTTP(s) protocol. A web page opened via the `file://` protocol cannot use import/export.

### Conclusion
Modules are a powerful tool for organizing your code and improving maintainability. As you advance in your learning, you will explore more about their usage and application.

# JavaScript JSON

### What is JSON?
Imagine JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) as a neatly packed suitcase for data. Just like you store your clothes in a suitcase for a trip, JSON helps us store and transport data efficiently.

- **JSON is a format for storing and transporting data.**
- **It is lightweight, like a small suitcase, making it easy to carry around.**
- **JSON is language-independent, meaning it can be understood by many different programming languages, just as a suitcase can be recognized by anyone, regardless of where they're from.**
- **JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand, much like labels on a suitcase that tell you what‚Äôs inside.**

### JSON Example
Here‚Äôs a simple JSON example that defines an "employees" object, which is like a list of passengers in our suitcase:

```json
{
  "employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
  ]
}
```

### JSON Format Evaluates to JavaScript Objects
The beautiful thing about JSON is that it looks like JavaScript. When you unpack the suitcase, you find the clothes neatly folded inside. Similarly, we can easily convert JSON data into JavaScript objects.

### JSON Syntax Rules
To keep our data organized in JSON, we have some simple rules, just like folding clothes in a specific way for a suitcase:

1. **Data is in name/value pairs:** Think of this as a tag on a shirt indicating its size. For example, `"firstName":"John"`.
2. **Data is separated by commas:** Like keeping shirts apart with small dividers in the suitcase.
3. **Curly braces hold objects:** This is like the suitcase itself, containing various items.
4. **Square brackets hold arrays:** Think of this as a drawer inside the suitcase containing multiple items, like socks.

### JSON Data - A Name and a Value
Each piece of JSON data is a name/value pair, similar to how every item in your suitcase has a name tag:

```json
"firstName":"John"
```

### JSON Objects
JSON objects are written inside curly braces, much like the suitcase containing all your clothes:

```json
{"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}
```

### JSON Arrays
JSON arrays are written inside square brackets. They hold multiple items, like a drawer filled with socks:

```json
"employees":[
  {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
  {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
  {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]
```

### Converting JSON Text to a JavaScript Object
Just like opening your suitcase to see what‚Äôs inside, we can convert a JSON string into a JavaScript object. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

1. Create a JavaScript string containing JSON syntax:

```javascript
let text = '{ "employees" : [' +
'{ "firstName":"John" , "lastName":"Doe" },' +
'{ "firstName":"Anna" , "lastName":"Smith" },' +
'{ "firstName":"Peter" , "lastName":"Jones" } ]}';
```

2. Use the built-in function `JSON.parse()` to unpack the suitcase:

```javascript
const obj = JSON.parse(text);
```

3. Finally, use the new JavaScript object in your page:

```html
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
obj.employees[1].firstName + " " + obj.employees[1].lastName;
</script>
```

# JavaScript Debugging

### Code Debugging
Imagine writing a recipe but making mistakes along the way. Sometimes, the dish doesn‚Äôt turn out as expected, and you must figure out what went wrong. This process of finding and fixing errors in your code is called debugging.

- **Errors can (and will) happen every time you write new code.**
- **Code might contain syntax errors (like misspelled words in a recipe) or logical errors (like forgetting to add an ingredient).**
- **Debugging helps you diagnose these errors. Often, nothing happens when there‚Äôs an error, like when your cake doesn‚Äôt rise, and you‚Äôre left wondering why.**

### JavaScript Debuggers
Fortunately, modern browsers have built-in JavaScript debuggers, much like having a sous chef to assist you in the kitchen:

- You can turn the debugger on and off, ensuring errors are reported, just like a sous chef alerts you to missing ingredients.
- With a debugger, you can set breakpoints (places to stop and examine your code) and check the values of variables, similar to tasting the dish at various stages of cooking.

To activate debugging, typically you press F12 and select "Console" in the debugger menu.

### The console.log() Method
If your browser supports debugging, you can use `console.log()` to display JavaScript values in the debugger window, like writing notes on your recipe to track what you did:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Web Page</h1>

<script>
a = 5;
b = 6;
c = a + b;
console.log(c); // This will show 11 in the console
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

### Setting Breakpoints
In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in your JavaScript code. At each breakpoint, JavaScript will pause execution, allowing you to check values, just like checking the oven temperature:

- After checking, you can resume execution (like putting the dish back in the oven).

### The debugger Keyword
Using the `debugger` keyword in your code is like placing a timer on your oven:

```javascript
let x = 15 * 5;
debugger; // Execution will pause here
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
```

### Major Browsers' Debugging Tools
To access debugging in different browsers, here‚Äôs what you typically do:

- **Chrome:** Press F12 > "More tools" > "Developer tools" > "Console".
- **Firefox:** Press F12 > "Web Developer" > "Web Console".
- **Edge:** Press F12 > "Developer Tools" > "Console".
- **Opera:** Press F12 > "Developer" > "Developer tools" > "Console".
- **Safari:** Enable the "Develop" menu, then choose "Show Error Console".

### Did You Know?
Debugging is the process of testing, finding, and reducing bugs (errors) in computer programs. The first known computer bug was a real bug (an insect) stuck in the electronics!

# JavaScript Style Guide

Always use the same coding conventions for all your JavaScript projects. Consistency is like having a common language in a conversation; it helps everyone understand each other better.

## JavaScript Coding Conventions

Coding conventions are style guidelines for programming. They typically cover:

- Naming and declaration rules for variables and functions.
- Rules for the use of white space, indentation, and comments.
- Programming practices and principles.

**Coding conventions secure quality:**

- Improve code readability
- Make code maintenance easier

These conventions can be documented rules for teams to follow or just your individual coding practice.

This page describes the general JavaScript code conventions used by W3Schools. You should also read the next chapter "Best Practices" and learn how to avoid coding pitfalls.

## Variable Names

At W3Schools, we use camelCase for identifier names (variables and functions). Think of it as a friendly little camel hopping over the words, connecting them:

```javascript
firstName = "John";
lastName = "Doe";
```

All names start with a letter:

```javascript
price = 19.90;
tax = 0.20;

fullPrice = price + (price * tax);
```

### Spaces Around Operators

Always put spaces around operators (`=`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), and after commas. This is like giving your code some breathing room:

```javascript
let x = y + z;
const myArray = ["Volvo", "Saab", "Fiat"];
```

## Code Indentation

Always use 2 spaces for indentation of code blocks. Think of it like organizing your desk; a clean, organized space helps you find things more easily:

```javascript
function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
  return (5 / 9) * (fahrenheit - 32);
}
```

Do not use tabs for indentation. Different editors interpret tabs differently, which can create confusion.

### Statement Rules

**General rules for simple statements:**

Always end a simple statement with a semicolon:

```javascript
const cars = ["Volvo", "Saab", "Fiat"];
```

**General rules for complex (compound) statements:**

- Put the opening bracket at the end of the first line.
- Use one space before the opening bracket.
- Put the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
- Do not end a complex statement with a semicolon.

```javascript
function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
  return (5 / 9) * (fahrenheit - 32);
}

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  x += i;
}

if (time < 20) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}
```

## Object Rules

**General rules for object definitions:**

- Place the opening bracket on the same line as the object name.
- Use a colon plus one space between each property and its value.
- Use quotes around string values, not around numeric values.
- Do not add a comma after the last property-value pair.
- Place the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
- Always end an object definition with a semicolon.

Example:

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};
```

Short objects can be written compressed, on one line, using spaces only between properties:

```javascript
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
```

## Line Length < 80

For readability, avoid lines longer than 80 characters. If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, break it after an operator or a comma:

```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";
```

## Naming Conventions

Always use the same naming convention for all your code. For example:

- Variable and function names written in camelCase.
- Global variables written in UPPERCASE (though not mandatory, it's common).
- Constants (like PI) written in UPPERCASE.

Should you use hyphens, camelCase, or underscores in variable names? This is a common topic of discussion among programmers. The answer often depends on personal or team preference.

### Hyphens in HTML and CSS

HTML5 attributes can start with `data-` (like `data-quantity`, `data-price`). CSS uses hyphens in property names (like `font-size`). However, hyphens can be mistaken as subtraction attempts and are not allowed in JavaScript names.

### Underscores

Many programmers prefer using underscores (like `date_of_birth`), especially in SQL databases. Underscores are also common in PHP documentation.

### PascalCase

PascalCase is often preferred by C programmers.

### camelCase

camelCase is used by JavaScript itself, jQuery, and other JavaScript libraries.

**Avoid starting names with a `$` sign.** It can conflict with many JavaScript library names.

## Loading JavaScript in HTML

Use simple syntax for loading external scripts (the type attribute is not necessary):

```html
<script src="myscript.js"></script>
```

## Accessing HTML Elements

A consequence of using "untidy" HTML styles might result in JavaScript errors. These two statements will produce different results:

```javascript
const obj = getElementById("Demo"); // Incorrect case

const obj = getElementById("demo"); // Correct case
```

If possible, use the same naming convention (as JavaScript) in HTML.

## File Extensions

- HTML files should have a `.html` extension (`.htm` is allowed).
- CSS files should have a `.css` extension.
- JavaScript files should have a `.js` extension.

## Use Lower Case File Names

Most web servers (like Apache, Unix) are case-sensitive about file names:

- `london.jpg` cannot be accessed as `London.jpg`.

Other web servers (like Microsoft, IIS) are not case-sensitive:

- `london.jpg` can be accessed as either `London.jpg` or `london.jpg`.

To avoid confusion, always use lower case file names if possible.

## Performance

Coding conventions are not used by computers. Most rules have little impact on the execution of programs. Indentation and extra spaces are not significant in small scripts. For code in development, prioritize readability. Larger production scripts can be minimized for performance.

# JavaScript Best Practices

**Avoid global variables, avoid new, avoid `==`, avoid `eval()`.**

## Avoid Global Variables

Minimize the use of global variables. This includes all data types, objects, and functions. Think of global variables like public property; they can be overwritten by other scripts. Use local variables instead and learn how to use closures.

### Always Declare Local Variables

All variables used in a function should be declared as local variables. Local variables must be declared with the `var`, `let`, or `const` keyword; otherwise, they will become global variables. Strict mode does not allow undeclared variables.

**Declarations on Top**

It's a good coding practice to put all declarations at the top of each script or function. This gives you cleaner code and provides a single place to look for local variables, making it easier to avoid unwanted global variables and re-declarations:

```javascript
// Declare at the beginning
let firstName, lastName, price, discount, fullPrice;

// Use later
firstName = "John";
lastName = "Doe";

price = 19.90;
discount = 0.10;

fullPrice = price - discount;
```

This also applies to loop variables:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  // Do something
}
```

## Initialize Variables

It's a good practice to initialize variables when you declare them. This provides cleaner code, offers a single place to initialize variables, and avoids undefined values:

```javascript
// Declare and initiate at the beginning
let firstName = "";
let lastName = "";
let price = 0;
let discount = 0;
let fullPrice = 0;

const myArray = [];
const myObject = {};
```

Initializing variables gives an idea of the intended use and data type.

## Declare Objects with `const`

Declaring objects with `const` will prevent accidental changes in type:

```javascript
let car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
car = "Fiat"; // Changes object to string

const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
car = "Fiat"; // Not possible
```

## Declare Arrays with `const`

The same applies to arrays. Declaring arrays with `const` will prevent accidental changes in type:

```javascript
let cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
cars = 3; // Changes array to number

const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
cars = 3; // Not possible
```

## Don't Use `new Object()`

Use `""` instead of `new String()`, `0` instead of `new Number()`, `false` instead of `new Boolean()`, `{}` instead of `new Object()`, `[]` instead of `new Array()`, `/()/` instead of `new RegExp()`, and `function (){}` instead of `new Function()`.

```javascript
let x1 = ""; // new primitive string
let x2 = 0; // new primitive number
let x3 = false; // new primitive boolean
const x4 = {}; // new object


const x5 = []; // new array
const x6 = /()/; // new regular expression
const x7 = function(){}; // new function
```

Using these conventions improves performance and reduces code size.

## Use `===` and `!==` instead of `==` and `!=`

Using `===` and `!==` checks the value and type of variables. This eliminates unexpected type coercion:

```javascript
const a = "5";
const b = 5;

// Using ==
console.log(a == b); // true
// Using ===
console.log(a === b); // false
```

## Avoid Using `eval()`

The `eval()` function executes the code it receives as a string. Avoid it if possible:

```javascript
const x = eval("2 + 2");
```

It can be slow, introduce security problems, and lead to debugging nightmares.

## Functions and Naming Conventions

- Always name your functions with a verb, like `calculateTotal()`, `formatDate()`, etc.
- Avoid overusing nested functions, as they can make your code less readable.
- Prefer arrow functions for anonymous functions or when using higher-order functions.

## Use Comments

- Use comments to explain the purpose of complex code.
- Keep comments concise and to the point.
- Remove commented-out code; it's usually better to delete it than leave it in.

## Use Strict Mode

Using strict mode helps you write cleaner code by catching common coding errors. Use `"use strict";` at the top of your scripts or functions:

```javascript
"use strict";
```

## Conclusion

By adhering to these guidelines and best practices, you can write cleaner, more maintainable, and less error-prone JavaScript code. Your code will be more understandable for yourself and others, just like a well-structured book!

# JavaScript Common Mistakes

This chapter points out some common JavaScript mistakes.

## Accidentally Using the Assignment Operator

Imagine you are trying to weigh yourself, but instead of stepping on the scale, you write down your weight on a piece of paper. In JavaScript, if you accidentally use the assignment operator `=` instead of the comparison operator `==` in an `if` statement, your program may yield unexpected results.

For example:

```javascript
let x = 0;
if (x == 10) { // This if statement returns false (as expected) because x is not equal to 10.
}
```

However, consider this:

```javascript
let x = 0;
if (x = 10) { // This if statement returns true (maybe not as expected), because x is now 10.
}
```

Here, `x` is assigned the value `10`, and thus the condition evaluates to true. Similarly:

```javascript
let x = 0;
if (x = 0) { // This if statement returns false (maybe not as expected), because 0 is considered false.
}
```

### Explanation

An assignment always returns the value of the assignment. Be cautious when writing conditions!

## Expecting Loose Comparison

Think of loose comparison like a wide-open door: it doesn‚Äôt care about what‚Äôs outside. In regular comparison, data types do not matter. This example returns true:

```javascript
let x = 10;
let y = "10";
if (x == y) { // This evaluates to true because the value is the same.
}
```

In contrast, strict comparison is like a locked door: it checks both value and type. This returns false:

```javascript
let x = 10;
let y = "10";
if (x === y) { // This evaluates to false because the types are different.
}
```

It's also common to forget that `switch` statements use strict comparison:

```javascript
let x = 10;
switch(x) {
  case 10: alert("Hello"); // This case will display an alert.
}
```

But:

```javascript
let x = 10;
switch(x) {
  case "10": alert("Hello"); // This case will not display an alert.
}
```

## Confusing Addition & Concatenation

Imagine trying to add apples and oranges together. In JavaScript, addition is about numbers, while concatenation is about strings, but both use the `+` operator.

When you add numbers:

```javascript
let x = 10;
x = 10 + 5; // Now x is 15
```

However, when adding a number and a string:

```javascript
let y = 10;
y += "5"; // Now y is "105"
```

This can lead to confusion:

```javascript
let x = 10;
let y = 5;
let z = x + y;     // Now z is 15

let x = 10;
let y = "5";
let z = x + y;     // Now z is "105"
```

### Explanation

Be mindful of data types when performing operations, as they can yield unexpected results.

## Misunderstanding Floats

Think of floating-point numbers as balancing on a tightrope: they can easily tip over. All numbers in JavaScript are stored as 64-bit floating-point numbers. This can lead to imprecise calculations:

```javascript
let x = 0.1;
let y = 0.2;
let z = x + y; // The result in z will not be exactly 0.3
```

To solve this issue, you can multiply and divide:

```javascript
let z = (x * 10 + y * 10) / 10; // z will be 0.3
```

## Breaking a JavaScript String

Consider a sentence as a long piece of string. JavaScript allows you to break a statement into two lines, but not in the middle of a string:

```javascript
let x =
"Hello World!"; // This works
```

However, this breaks the string:

```javascript
let x = "Hello
World!"; // This will not work.
```

To break a statement in a string correctly, use a backslash:

```javascript
let x = "Hello \
World!"; // This works.
```

## Misplacing Semicolon

Think of a misplaced semicolon as putting a lock on a door you wanted to leave open. Because of it, this code block will execute regardless of the value of `x`:

```javascript
if (x == 19); // The semicolon here ends the if statement.
{
  // code block 
}
```

## Breaking a Return Statement

Imagine that at the end of a line, the story abruptly ends. JavaScript automatically closes statements at the end of a line.

This function will work fine:

```javascript
function myFunction(a) {
  let power = 10; 
  return a * power;
}
```

But what happens if you break the return statement like this:

```javascript
function myFunction(a) {
  let power = 10; 
  return
  a * power; // This will return undefined!
}
```

### Explanation

JavaScript thinks you meant:

```javascript
function myFunction(a) {
  let power = 10; 
  return; // The return statement closes here.
  a * power;
}
```

Because ending statements with a semicolon is optional in JavaScript, the return statement gets closed automatically.

### Key Point

Never break a return statement.

## Accessing Arrays with Named Indexes

Think of arrays like numbered lockers. Many programming languages support associative arrays (or hashes) with named indexes, but JavaScript does not.

In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes:

```javascript
const person = [];
person[0] = "John";
person[1] = "Doe";
person[2] = 46;
person.length;       // This returns 3
person[0];           // This returns "John"
```

If you use a named index while accessing an array, JavaScript will redefine it to a standard object:

```javascript
const person = [];
person["firstName"] = "John"; // This redefines the array.
person["lastName"] = "Doe";
person["age"] = 46;
person.length;      // This returns 0
person[0];          // This returns undefined
```

## Ending Definitions with a Comma

Trailing commas in object and array definitions are legal in ECMAScript 5, but beware:

```javascript
person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:46,}; // Object example
points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10,]; // Array example
```

**WARNING:** 

Internet Explorer 8 will crash, and JSON does not allow trailing commas.

## Undefined is Not Null

In JavaScript, variables, properties, and methods can be `undefined`, while empty objects can have the value `null`. This makes testing for an empty object tricky.

To check if an object exists:

```javascript
if (typeof myObj === "undefined") 
```

However, testing for `null` can throw an error if the object is `undefined`:

```javascript
if (myObj === null) // This is incorrect.
```

### Correct Approach

Test if an object is not `null` and not `undefined`:

```javascript
if (typeof myObj !== "undefined" && myObj !== null) // This is correct.
```

Be mindful of these common mistakes to ensure smoother coding in JavaScript!

# JavaScript Performance

## How to Speed Up Your JavaScript Code

### Reduce Activity in Loops

Loops are like a worker on an assembly line. If every time the worker needs to check how long the line is, it slows down production. 

**Bad Example:**
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    // do something with arr[i]
}
```

**Better Code:**
```javascript
let l = arr.length; // Store the length outside the loop
for (let i = 0; i < l; i++) {
    // do something with arr[i]
}
```

In the bad example, the code checks the length of the array during every iteration, which is inefficient. In the better code, we store the length in a variable before the loop, making it faster because it avoids repetitive checks.

### Reduce DOM Access

Accessing the Document Object Model (DOM) is like trying to find a book in a huge library. The more you search, the more time it takes. 

**Example:**
```javascript
const obj = document.getElementById("demo"); // Access once
obj.innerHTML = "Hello"; // Use the local variable
```

Instead of searching the DOM multiple times, access an element once and store it in a variable. This speeds up your code by reducing the number of searches.

### Reduce DOM Size

A cluttered library is hard to navigate. Similarly, a large DOM slows down page loading and rendering.

**Tip:** Keep the number of elements in the HTML DOM small. This improves loading speed and enhances performance, especially on smaller devices. Fewer elements mean faster searches and rendering.

### Avoid Unnecessary Variables

Creating unnecessary variables is like bringing extra tools to a simple job. It complicates things without adding value.

**Instead of this:**
```javascript
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fullName;
```

**Do this:**
```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = firstName + " " + lastName; // Directly assign
```

By directly assigning the value, you simplify your code and improve performance.

### Delay JavaScript Loading

Think of loading scripts as setting up a stage for a show. If the stage is not ready, you can't start the performance.

Placing your scripts at the bottom of the page allows the browser to load the main content first. While the script is loading, the browser can‚Äôt perform other tasks, slowing down the overall loading time.

**Better Approach:**
```html
<script>
window.onload = function() {
    const element = document.createElement("script");
    element.src = "myScript.js"; // Load script after the page is ready
    document.body.appendChild(element);
};
</script>
```

Using the `defer` attribute in the script tag is another option. It ensures that the script runs only after the page has finished loading.

### Avoid Using `with`

Using the `with` keyword is like giving someone too many instructions at once; it can create confusion and slow things down. 

**Note:** The `with` keyword is not allowed in strict mode, so it's best to avoid it altogether.

# JavaScript Reserved Words

In JavaScript, certain words are reserved and cannot be used as variable names, labels, or function names. These reserved words act like "no parking" signs in a neighborhood ‚Äî they signal that you can't use that space for something else.

## Reserved Words

Here are some examples of reserved words:

- `abstract`
- `arguments`
- `await` (ES6)
- `boolean`
- `break`
- `case`
- `catch`

Words marked with an asterisk (*) were introduced in ECMAScript 5 and 6.

### Removed Reserved Words

The following words have been removed from the ECMAScript 5/6 standard and should not be used as variables:

- `abstract`
- `boolean`
- `byte`
- `char`
- `double`
- `final`
- `float`
- `goto`
- `int`
- `long`
- `native`
- `short`
- `synchronized`
- `throws`
- `transient`
- `volatile`

### JavaScript Built-In Objects, Properties, and Methods

Avoid using names of built-in objects and properties as identifiers:

- `Array`
- `Date`
- `eval`
- `Function`
- `Math`
- `String`

### Java Reserved Words

If you're working with Java, avoid using these names as JavaScript identifiers:

- `getClass`
- `JavaObject`
- `JavaPackage`

### Other Reserved Words

JavaScript can also interact with HTML, so avoid using names of HTML and Window objects:

- `alert`
- `document`
