# Basic Concepts Git with Analogies

## Git Commands: Building a Project with Bricks

Imagine you are building a house. Each wall represents a function or feature of your project, and the bricks are the small changes or modifications you make. Git allows you to manage those bricks to ensure your construction is solid and that you can revert to previous versions if something goes wrong.

### `git add`
**What does it do?**  
This command takes the changes you've made and moves them to the "staging area." Think of it as stacking bricks (changes) in a cart, but you haven't placed them in the wall yet (they're not official yet). You use `git add` to select the bricks you want to use.

**Technical Concept:**  
`git add` moves modified files from your working directory to the staging area, allowing you to prepare a snapshot before committing.

- 📚 **Related Tutorials:**  
  - Save changes: `git add`
  - Use branches: `git merge`
  - Inspect a repository: `git status`

### `git commit`
**What does it do?**  
This command is like putting the bricks into the wall. Once you are satisfied with the changes, you officially place them into the history of your project. Each commit is like a snapshot of the house at that moment, showing the progress.

**Technical Concept:**  
`git commit` takes the changes you have staged and saves them in the project history. Along with `git add`, it is part of the basic workflow in Git.

- 📚 **Related Tutorials:**  
  - Use branches: `git merge`
  - Rewrite history: `git commit --amend`

### `git branch`
**What does it do?**  
Imagine you want to build a garage next to your house. You don't want to mess up the main house, so you create a separate branch where you can work without interfering. If you like how the garage turns out, you merge it back into the main project.

**Technical Concept:**  
`git branch` allows you to create and manage branches. Branches are isolated development environments within a repository where you can work on new features or fixes without affecting the main branch.

- 📚 **Related Tutorials:**  
  - Use branches: `git branch`
  - Use branches: `git merge`

### `git checkout`
**What does it do?**  
If you want to see how the garage turned out before finishing it, you can go to that part of the project without changing the rest. You use `git checkout` to switch between branches and view previous versions of your house.

**Technical Concept:**  
`git checkout` allows you to switch between branches or review previous commits. It's a way to navigate through different lines of development.

- 📚 **Related Tutorials:**  
  - Use branches: `git checkout`
  - Undo changes: `git checkout`

### `git clone`
**What does it do?**  
This is like getting an exact copy of a finished house so you can make your modifications. With `git clone`, you obtain a complete copy of the repository on your machine.

**Technical Concept:**  
`git clone` creates a local copy of an existing repository. It is the most common way for developers to obtain a working copy of a central repository.

- 📚 **Related Tutorials:**  
  - Set up a repository: `git clone`

# What is Version Control?

Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, these systems help teams work faster and smarter. They are especially useful for DevOps teams since they help them reduce development time and increase successful deployments.

## Analogy: Code as Treasure

Imagine that the source code of a software project is like a precious treasure that must be protected. This treasure contains valuable knowledge that developers have gathered and refined through careful effort. Version control protects this source code from both catastrophe and the casual degradation caused by human error and unintended consequences.

## How Version Control Works

Software developers working in teams are continually writing new code and changing existing code. The code for a project, app, or software component is typically organized in a folder structure or "file tree." One developer on the team may be working on a new feature while another fixes an unrelated bug by changing the code. Each developer may make their changes in several parts of the file tree.

### Analogy: A Carpentry Workshop

Think of a carpentry workshop where several carpenters are building furniture. Each one has their own project and is working in different parts of the workshop. If one of them decides to make a change to a design, version control is like a system that records every modification made by the carpenters, ensuring that there are no conflicts between their work.

### Benefits of Version Control

Using version control software is a best practice for high-performing software and DevOps teams. It helps developers move faster and allows software teams to maintain efficiency and agility as the team scales.

1. **Complete Long-Term Change History:** Every change made by contributors is recorded, including the creation and deletion of files as well as edits to their contents. This history enables reverting to previous versions and assists in root cause analysis for bugs.

2. **Branching and Merging:** Having team members work concurrently is crucial. Branches allow each developer to work on their own "section" of the project without interfering with others, and they can later merge their changes.

3. **Traceability:** The ability to trace each change made to the software and connect it to project management and bug tracking tools like Jira allows developers to understand the purpose of each change. This is especially important when working with legacy code.

## Conclusion

While it is possible to develop software without using any version control system, doing so exposes the project to significant risks that no professional team should accept. The question is not whether to use version control, but which version control system to use.

# Source Code Management (SCM)

Source Code Management (SCM) is used to track modifications to a source code repository. SCM maintains a history of changes made to a code base and helps resolve conflicts when merging updates from multiple contributors. SCM is synonymous with version control.

## Analogy: A Family Archive

Imagine the source code of a software project as a family archive that contains valuable photos and memories. As the family grows and new memories are added, the archive can become messy. Source Code Management acts like an organized filing cabinet that helps keep everything in its place, ensuring that each memory is preserved and not lost.

## The Importance of Source Code Management Tools

When multiple developers are working within a shared codebase, it’s common to make edits to a piece of code that everyone uses. While developers might be working on seemingly isolated features, these features often utilize shared code modules. Therefore, Developer 1 working on Feature 1 may make some edits and later find out that Developer 2 working on Feature 2 has conflicting edits.

### Analogy: A Shared Kitchen

Think of a kitchen where several chefs are preparing different dishes. If one chef decides to modify the recipe for a dish that another chef is also making, conflicts may arise. Without proper management, one chef could ruin the other's recipe. SCM acts like a kitchen coordinator that helps prevent such situations from becoming a disaster.

Before the adoption of SCM, this type of conflict was a nightmare scenario. Developers would edit text files directly and move them to remote locations using FTP or other protocols. Developer 1 could make changes, and Developer 2, unknowingly, could overwrite Developer 1's work. The role of SCM as a protection mechanism against this specific scenario is known as Version Control.

SCM implements version control safeguards to prevent loss of work due to conflict overwriting. These safeguards work by tracking changes from each individual developer and identifying areas of conflict, preventing overwrites. SCM then communicates these conflict points back to the developers so they can safely review and address them.

## Benefits of Source Code Management

In addition to version control, SCM provides a suite of helpful features that make collaborative code development a more user-friendly experience. Once SCM has started tracking all changes to a project over time, a detailed historical record of the project's life is created. This historical record can then be used to "undo" changes to the codebase. SCM can instantly revert the codebase back to a previous point in time. This is extremely valuable for preventing regressions on updates and undoing mistakes.

### Analogy: The Toolbox

Imagine that the change history is like a well-organized toolbox. Each tool represents a change in the project, and if something breaks, you can go back to an earlier tool that you know worked. This not only facilitates repair but also provides a record of all the tools used, which can be helpful for future projects.

The SCM archive of every change over a project’s lifetime provides valuable record-keeping for a project’s release version notes. A clean and maintained SCM history log can be used as release notes, offering insight and transparency into the progress of a project that can be shared with end users or non-development teams.

SCM will reduce a team’s communication overhead and increase release velocity. Without SCM, development is slower because contributors have to take extra effort to plan a non-overlapping sequence of development for release. With SCM, developers can work independently on separate branches of feature development, eventually merging them together.

Overall, SCM is a huge aid to engineering teams that will lower development costs by allowing engineering resources to execute their work more efficiently. SCM is a must-have in the modern age of software development. Professional teams use version control, and your team should too.

## Best Practices for Source Code Management

1. **Commit Often:** Commits are cheap and easy to make. They should be made frequently to capture updates to the code base. Each commit is a snapshot to which the codebase can be reverted if needed. Frequent commits provide many opportunities to revert or undo work.

2. **Ensure You’re Working from the Latest Version:** SCM enables rapid updates from multiple developers. It’s easy to have a local copy of the codebase fall behind the global copy. Make sure to run `git pull` or `git fetch` to get the latest code before making updates. This will help avoid conflicts at merge time.

3. **Make Detailed Notes:** Each commit has a corresponding log entry. At the time of commit creation, this entry is populated with a message. It is important to leave descriptive explanatory commit log messages. These commit log messages should explain the “why” and “what” that encompass the commit's content. These log messages become the canonical history of the project’s development and leave a trail for future contributors to review.

4. **Review Changes Before Committing:** SCM offers a ‘staging area’. The staging area can be used to collect a group of edits before writing them to a commit. Using the staging area in this manner provides a buffer area to help refine the contents of the commit.

5. **Use Branches:** Branching is a powerful SCM mechanism that allows developers to create a separate line of development. Branches should be used frequently as they are quick and inexpensive. Branches enable multiple developers to work in parallel on separate lines of development. When development is complete on a branch, it is then merged into the main line of development.

6. **Agree on a Workflow:** By default, SCMs offer very free-form methods of contribution. It is important that teams establish shared patterns of collaboration. SCM workflows establish patterns and processes for merging branches. If a team doesn't agree on a shared workflow, it can lead to inefficient communication overhead when it comes time to merge branches.

## Summary

SCM is an invaluable tool for modern software development. The best software teams use SCM, and your team should too. SCM is very easy to set up on a new project, and the return on investment is high. Atlassian offers some of the best SCM integration tools in the world that will help you get started.

# What is Git?

Git is, by far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today. It is a mature, actively maintained open-source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel.

## Analogy: The Personal Library

Imagine that each developer has their own personal library. In this library, not only is there a copy of each book (the code), but also a record of all the changes made to each book. So every time an author (developer) modifies a work (code file), they can log that modification and revert to previous versions if necessary. Git allows each author to keep their own copy of the books with all their history while also being able to share with other libraries (remote repositories).

## Distributed Architecture

Git is an example of a **DVCS** (Distributed Version Control System). Instead of having a single place where the entire version history of the software is stored, each developer's working copy of the code also acts as a repository that contains the complete history of changes. This means that developers can work independently and make changes without needing to connect to a central server.

### Technical Concept: Local Repository

Each developer has a **local repository**, which includes all version information, allowing them to make changes, commits, and create branches without depending on the network.

## Performance

The performance characteristics of Git are exceptional compared to many alternatives. Operations such as **committing** (saving changes), **branching** (creating branches), and **merging** (combining branches) are optimized for speed.

### Analogy: Automated Backup Service

Think of Git as an automated backup service that allows you to make changes to your files and have the option to revert to a previous version effortlessly. For example, if Alice (a developer) makes changes to her code for the 2.0 release of a project, she can continue working without interruptions. If she needs to fix a bug in version 1.3, she can switch branches and fix the issue without needing to go to a central library; everything is available in her own copy.

## Security

The integrity of the source code is a top priority in Git. It uses a cryptographically secure hashing algorithm called **SHA-1** to protect the content of files and the history of changes. This ensures that the code and the change history are traceable and protected against malicious alterations.

### Technical Concept: Change History

In Git, each change is recorded with a unique identifier. This means you can be sure that no secret changes have occurred in the code after it has been logged. It's like having a notary verify each change to your important documents.

## Flexibility

One of Git's key design objectives is flexibility. Git can adapt to various development workflows and allows for **branching** and **tagging** as first-class features, enabling efficient operations like merging or reverting changes.

### Analogy: The Family Tree

Think of Git like a family tree. Each branch represents a new feature or change in the code. You can create branches to experiment with new ideas, and if something works, merge it back into the main branch. This is crucial for keeping the workflow organized and agile.

## Conclusion

Git is the best choice for most software teams today. It provides the functionality, performance, security, and flexibility that many teams and individual developers need. Additionally, its standardization as a widely adopted tool makes it easy to find developers who already have experience with Git.

### Criticism of Git

A common criticism is that it can be difficult to learn, especially for those coming from non-distributed version control systems. The terminology can be confusing at first, but once you overcome the learning curve, Git offers significant power that can accelerate development.

## Final Reflection

Now that you understand what version control is, what Git is, and why software teams should use it, read on to discover the benefits Git can provide across the whole organization.

# Why Use Git in Your Organization?

Shifting from a centralized version control system to Git transforms how your development team creates software. And if you’re a business that relies on software for critical applications, modifying your development workflow impacts your entire business.

In this article, we’ll discuss how Git benefits every aspect of your organization, from your development team to your marketing team and everything in between. By the end of this article, it should be clear that Git is not just for agile software development—it’s for an agile business!

## Organizational Development

### Git for Developers

#### Feature Branch Workflow

One of the biggest advantages of Git is its branching capability. Unlike centralized version control systems, branches in Git are inexpensive and easy to merge. This facilitates the feature branch workflow, popular among many Git users.

**Analogy**: Imagine your project as a tree. The main branch (master) represents the most recent and stable version of your software. Whenever a developer wants to work on a new feature, they create a new branch, like a new branch off the tree. This ensures that the main branch always contains production-ready code.

Using feature branches is not only more reliable than editing production code directly, but it also provides organizational benefits. It allows you to represent development work with the same granularity as your agile backlog. For instance, you could implement a policy where each Jira ticket is addressed in its own feature branch.

### Distributed Development

In SVN, each developer gets a working copy that points to a single central repository. However, Git is a distributed version control system. Instead of a working copy, each developer has their own local repository, complete with a full commit history.

**Analogy**: Think of it as each developer having their own notebook where they can jot down ideas and progress. Whenever they write something, they can do so without needing to connect to a central server. This makes Git fast, as you don’t need a network connection to create commits, inspect previous versions of a file, or perform comparisons between commits.

Distributed development also makes it easier to scale your engineering team. If someone breaks the production branch in SVN, other developers can’t register their changes until it’s fixed. With Git, this kind of blocking doesn’t exist. Everyone can continue working in their own local repositories.

And, similar to feature branches, distributed development creates a more reliable environment. Even if a developer accidentally deletes their own repository, they can clone someone else’s repository and start anew.

### Pull Requests

Many source code management tools, like Bitbucket, enhance Git’s core functionality with pull requests. A pull request is a way to ask another developer to merge one of your branches into their repository. This not only makes it easier for project leaders to follow changes but also allows developers to initiate discussions about their work before integrating it with the rest of the code.

**Analogy**: Think of pull requests as a formal request to show your coworker what you’ve done. When you’re stuck on a tricky problem, you can open a pull request to ask the rest of the team for help. Alternatively, junior developers may feel more confident knowing they’re not breaking the project by treating pull requests as a formal code review.

### Community

In many circles, Git has become the expected version control system for new projects. If your team is using Git, it’s likely that you won’t have to train new employees on your workflow because they will already be familiar with distributed development.

Moreover, Git is very popular among open-source projects. This means it’s easy to leverage third-party libraries and encourage others to fork your own open-source code.

### Faster Release Cycle

The end result of feature branches, distributed development, pull requests, and a stable community is a faster release cycle. These capabilities facilitate an agile workflow where developers are encouraged to share smaller changes more frequently. In turn, changes can be pushed through the deployment pipeline faster than the monolithic releases common in centralized version control systems.

**Analogy**: Imagine that instead of launching a massive project all at once at the end of the year, your team releases small updates every month. This not only keeps users engaged but also allows for quick bug fixes.

As expected, Git works very well in continuous integration and continuous delivery environments. Git hooks allow you to run scripts when certain events occur within a repository, enabling you to automate deployment to your liking. You can even build or deploy code from specific branches to different servers.

For example, you could set up Git to deploy the most recent commit from the development branch to a test server every time someone merges a pull request into it. Combining this type of build automation with peer reviews means you have the highest possible confidence in your code as it moves from development to staging and then to production.

## Git for Marketing

To understand how switching to Git affects your company’s marketing activities, imagine your development team has three distinct changes scheduled for completion in the coming weeks:

1. The whole team is finalizing a groundbreaking feature they’ve been working on for the past 6 months.
2. Maria is implementing a smaller, unrelated feature that only impacts existing customers.
3. Rick is making some necessary updates to the user interface.

If you’re using a traditional development workflow that relies on a centralized VCS, all of these changes would likely be bundled into a single release. Marketing could only make an announcement that primarily focuses on the groundbreaking feature, effectively ignoring the marketing potential of the other two updates.

The shorter development cycle facilitated by Git makes it much easier to split these into individual releases. This gives marketers more to talk about, more often. In the previous scenario, marketing can build three campaigns around each feature, thus targeting very specific market segments.

## Git for Product Management

The benefits of Git for product management are very similar to those for marketing. More frequent releases mean more frequent customer feedback and faster updates in reaction to that feedback. Instead of waiting for the next release in 8 weeks, you can send a fix to customers as quickly as your developers can write the code.

### Priority Management and Git Workflow

The feature branch workflow also provides flexibility when priorities shift. For example, if you’re halfway through a release cycle and want to postpone one feature in favor of another that’s time-critical, no problem. That initial feature can remain in its own branch until the engineering team has time to return to it.

This same functionality makes it easy to manage innovation projects, beta testing, and rapid prototyping as independent codebases.

## Git for Designers

Feature branches lend themselves well to rapid prototyping. Whether your UX/UI designers want to implement a completely new user flow or just replace some icons, reviewing a new branch gives them an isolated environment to experiment in. This allows designers to see how their changes will look in a real copy of the product without the risk of breaking existing functionality.

**Analogy**: Think of this as having a testing room where you can experiment with new designs without fear of ruining what already works. If the engineering director wants to see what the design team has been up to, all they have to do is ask to review the corresponding branch.

Pull requests take this a step further and provide a formal place for stakeholders to discuss the new interface. Designers can make necessary changes, and the resulting commits will appear in the pull request. This invites everyone to participate in the iteration process.

Perhaps the best part of prototyping with branches is that it’s just as easy to merge changes into production as it is to discard them. There’s no pressure to do either. This encourages designers and UI developers to experiment while ensuring that only the best ideas reach the customer.

## Git for Customer Support

Customer support and customer success teams often have a different perspective on updates than product managers. When a customer calls them, they are usually experiencing some type of issue. If that issue is caused by your company’s software, a fix is needed as soon as possible.

The optimized development cycle of Git avoids delaying bug fixes until the next monolithic release. A developer can address the issue and send it directly to production. Faster fixes mean happier customers and fewer repeated support tickets. Instead of being left with a “Sorry, we’ll take care of that,” your support team can start responding with “We’ve already fixed that issue!”

## Git for Management

Git not only improves the development process; it also helps management make better decisions. Those decisions are driven by the information they get from the development team.

Performance metrics, commit performance, and branch usage in the system become easier to capture and analyze. This means that, as a manager, you can see how each of your teams is performing, how many updates are being sent to the software, and how work is flowing.

With this data in hand, you can make more informed decisions about which teams and projects to prioritize.

## Conclusion

If your organization isn’t using Git, you’re likely operating with less efficiency than you could be. Git is not just a tool for developers; it’s a cultural shift that affects every aspect of your business. The benefits you gain from adopting Git extend far beyond agile software development. As a result, your organization becomes an agile business. Don’t wait any longer to make the switch!

# Install Git on Mac OS X

Installing Git on Mac OS X can be done in several ways. In fact, if you've installed Xcode (or its Command Line Tools), Git may already be installed. To check if Git is installed, open a terminal and enter:

```bash
$ git --version
```

If Git is installed, you'll see something like:

```
git version 2.7.0 (Apple Git-66)
```

Apple maintains its own fork of Git, but it may lag behind the mainstream version. If you want to install a newer version, you can choose one of the methods below:

## Git for Mac Installer

The easiest way to install Git on a Mac is via the stand-alone installer:

1. Download the latest Git for Mac installer.
2. Follow the prompts to install Git.
3. Open a terminal and verify the installation was successful by typing:

```bash
$ git --version
```

You should see an output similar to:

```
git version 2.9.2
```

4. Configure your Git username and email using the following commands, replacing "Emma Paris" with your own name. These details will be associated with any commits that you create:

```bash

5. (Optional) To make Git remember your username and password for HTTPS repositories, configure the `git-credential-osxkeychain` helper.

## Install the `git-credential-osxkeychain` Helper

Bitbucket supports pushing and pulling your Git repositories over both SSH and HTTPS. To work with a private repository over HTTPS, you need to supply a username and password each time you push or pull. The `git-credential-osxkeychain` helper allows you to cache your username and password in the OSX keychain, so you don't have to retype it every time.

1. If you followed the MacPorts or Homebrew instructions above, the helper should already be installed. Otherwise, check if it's installed by running:

```bash
$ git credential-osxkeychain
```

If you see a usage statement, skip to step 4. If the helper is not installed, proceed to step 2.

2. Use `curl` to download `git-credential-osxkeychain` (or download it via your browser) and move it to `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
$ curl -O http://github-media-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/osx/git-credential-osxkeychain
$ sudo mv git-credential-osxkeychain /usr/local/bin/
```

3. Make the file executable:

```bash
$ chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/git-credential-osxkeychain
```

4. Configure Git to use the osxkeychain credential helper:

```bash
$ git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

The next time Git prompts you for a username and password, it will cache them in your keychain for future use.

# What is a Git SSH Key?

An SSH key is an access credential for the SSH (secure shell) network protocol. This authenticated and encrypted secure network protocol is used for remote communication between machines on an unsecured open network. SSH is used for remote file transfer, network management, and remote operating system access. It also refers to a set of tools used to interact with the SSH protocol.

## Analogy: The Key and the Lock

Think of the SSH key as a lock on a door. This lock consists of a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key can be shared with others, while the private key is a secret that you must keep safe.

- **Public Key (lock)**: You give this to others so they can "lock" the door in a way that only you, with your private key, can open it.
- **Private Key (key)**: This is yours, and you must keep it in a secure place. Without this key, no one can unlock the door.

## How to Create an SSH Key

SSH keys are generated through a public key cryptographic algorithm, the most common being RSA or DSA. In simple terms, SSH keys are generated using a mathematical formula that takes two prime numbers and a random seed variable to produce the public and private keys.

Think of this like a recipe: the ingredients are the prime numbers and the random variable, and the recipe produces the final result: your pair of keys.

### Steps to Create an SSH Key on Mac and Linux

Both Mac and Linux operating systems come with a modern terminal that includes the SSH suite. The process for creating an SSH key is the same for both.

1. **Run the following command to start creating the key:**

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   This command will create a new SSH key using your email as a label.

2. **You will be prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key."** You can specify a location or press "Enter" to accept the default location.

   ```
   Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]
   ```

3. **The next prompt will ask for a secure passphrase.** A passphrase adds an additional layer of security to the SSH key and will be required anytime the SSH key is used.

   ```
   Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
   Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
   ```

   At this point, a new SSH key will have been generated at the specified file path.

4. **Add the new SSH key to the ssh-agent.**

   The ssh-agent is another program that is part of the SSH toolsuite. Think of it like a keychain that holds your private keys. Before adding the new SSH key to the ssh-agent, ensure it is running by executing:

   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```

   Once the ssh-agent is running, the following command will add the new SSH key to the local SSH agent.

   ```bash
   ssh-add -K /Users/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

   The new SSH key is now registered and ready to use!

### Generate an SSH Key on Windows

Windows environments do not have a standard default Unix shell. You will need to install external shell programs to have a complete keygen experience. The most straightforward option is to utilize **Git Bash**. Once Git Bash is installed, you can follow the same steps for Linux and Mac within the Git Bash shell.

#### Windows Linux Subsystem

Modern Windows environments offer a Windows Linux Subsystem. If this is available, you can follow the same steps previously discussed for Linux and Mac within the Windows Linux Subsystem.

## Summary

SSH keys are used to authenticate secure connections. By following this guide, you will be able to create and start using an SSH key. Git can use SSH keys instead of traditional password authentication when pushing or pulling to remote repositories. Modern hosted Git solutions like Bitbucket support SSH key authentication.

# Git Archive: How to Export a Git Project

Sometimes, it can be useful to create an archive file of a Git repository. An archive file combines multiple files into a single file. An archive file can then be extracted to reproduce the individual files. Git is incredibly powerful at preserving history and team collaboration; however, archive files remove the overhead of Git's metadata and can be simpler to distribute to other users or preserve in long-term cold storage.

## Analogy: The Library Archive

Imagine you have a library in your home (your Git repository) filled with books (files). Every time you want to share a book, it can be a bit complicated because you have to explain what books you have, which shelves they’re on, and other details. 

So, you decide to create an **archive** of your most popular books. This archive is like a **Git Archive**: it takes the books you selected and puts them into a box (a single file), making it easier to share or store. When someone receives the box, they can open it and see only the books you chose, without the clutter of the entire library.

## What does `git archive` do?

The `git archive` command is a Git command-line utility that creates an archive file from specified Git refs like commits, branches, or trees. This command accepts additional arguments that will alter the archive output.

### Git Export Examples

A basic example of `git archive` follows:

```bash
git archive --format=tar HEAD
```

When executed, this command will create an archive from the current HEAD ref of the repository. By default, `git archive` will stream the archive output to the ephemeral stdout stream. You need to capture this output stream to a permanent file. You can specify a permanent file using the `git archive` output option or by using the operating system's stdout redirection.

```bash
git archive --output=./example_repo_archive.tar --format=tar HEAD
```

The previous example will create a new archive and store it in the `example_repo_archive.tar` file. The previous examples have both created uncompressed archive output. This is denoted by the `--format=tar` option. The format option also accepts popular compressed file formats such as `zip` and `tar.gz`. Passing one of these format options will produce a compressed archive. If a format value is not passed, it will be inferred from any `--output` option passed.

```bash
git archive --output=./example_repo_archive.tar.gz --format=tar HEAD ./build
```

A partial archive of the repository can be created by passing a path argument. This example adds a `./build` path argument to the archive command. This command will output an archive containing only the files stored under the `./build` directory.

## Options

The previous examples demonstrated some of the most frequently used `git archive` use cases. The following are extended options that can be passed to `git archive`.

- **`--prefix=<prefix>/`**: The prefix option prepends a path to each file in an archive. This can be helpful to ensure the archive contents get extracted in a unique namespace.

- **`--remote=<repo>`**: The remote option expects a remote repository URL. When invoked with the remote option, `git archive` will fetch the remote repository and create an archive from the specified ref if it’s available on the remote.

## Configuration

There are a few global Git configuration values that `git archive` will respect. These values can be set using the `git config` utility.

- **`tar.umask`**: The umask configuration option is used to specify Unix-level permission bit restrictions on the output archive file.

- **`tar.<format>.command`**: This configuration option allows specification of a custom shell command that the `git archive` output will be run through. This is similar to omitting the `--output` option and piping the stdout stream from `git archive` to a custom tool. This enables fixed custom archive post-processing.

- **`tar.<format>.remote`**: If enabled, this allows remote clients to fetch archives of type format.

## Git Archive Summary

`git archive` is a helpful utility for creating distributable packages of Git repositories. It can target specific refs of a repository and only package the contents of that ref. `git archive` has several output formats that can utilize added compression.

# Is GitOps the Next Big Thing in DevOps?

Many organizations now see DevOps as part of their digital transformation strategy since it encourages a culture of shared responsibility, transparency, and faster feedback. Yet as the gap between development and operations teams shrinks, so do the processes.

So it goes with Git, the most widely used version control system in the world today. As companies embrace DevOps methodologies, so too do the tools, which has created an evolution to GitOps—a set of practices that allow developers to perform more IT operations-related tasks.

## What is GitOps?

At its core, GitOps is code-based infrastructure and operational procedures that rely on Git as a source control system. It’s an evolution of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and a DevOps best practice that leverages Git as the single source of truth and control mechanism for creating, updating, and deleting system architecture. More simply, it is the practice of using Git pull requests to verify and automatically deploy system infrastructure modifications.

In addition to Git as a key DevOps mechanism, GitOps is also used to describe tools that augment Git's default functionality. These tools were primarily used with operating models for Kubernetes-based infrastructure and applications. There is ongoing development and discussion within the DevOps community to bring GitOps tools to other non-Kubernetes platforms, such as Terraform.

GitOps ensures that a system’s cloud infrastructure is immediately reproducible based on the state of a Git repository. Pull requests modify the state of the Git repository. Once approved and merged, the pull requests will automatically reconfigure and sync the live infrastructure to the state of the repository. This live syncing pull request workflow is the core essence of GitOps.

## The History of GitOps

Git is a mission-critical tool for software development that enables pull request and code review workflows. Pull requests promote visibility into incoming changes to a codebase and encourage communication, discussion, and review of changes.

Pull requests are a pivotal feature in collaborative software development and changed the way teams and businesses build software. Pull requests bring transparency and measurability to a formerly opaque process. Git pull requests helped enable the evolution of DevOps processes into software development. System administrators, who typically were hesitant to change, are now embracing new software development practices such as agile and DevOps.

Systems administration as a craft has a sloppy history. System administrators previously managed hardware manually by either connecting to and provisioning machines in a physical server rack or over a cloud provisioning API. In addition to the manual provisioning process, large amounts of manual configuration work were a regular routine. Administrators kept custom collections of imperative scripts and configurations, cobbled them together, and placed them in various places. These scripts could break at any time or get lost. Collaboration was challenging as the custom tool chains were not regularly documented or shared.

The DevOps movement arose from this primordial swamp of systems administration. DevOps borrowed the best ideas from software engineering and applied them to systems administration, where the cobbled-together tools became version-controlled code.

IaC is one of the biggest revelations of DevOps. Previously, system administrators favored custom imperative scripts to configure systems. Imperative software follows a sequence of steps to achieve a desired state, such as:

1. Install an operating system on this machine
2. Install these dependencies
3. Download code from this URL
4. Move the code to this directory
5. Do this 3 times for 3 other machines

The declarative version of this would simply read: **4 machines have software from this URL, installed at this directory.**

IaC encourages and promotes declarative system administration tools over custom imperative solutions. This led to the emergence of technologies like Docker Containers, Ansible, Terraform, and Kubernetes, which utilize static declarative configuration files. Human readability and consistent reproducible state are the beneficial outcomes. These configuration files were naturally added to Git for tracking and review. This is close but not quite GitOps.

Many of the traditional system administration problems have been solved at this point in DevOps history. Configuration files and tools are now stored in a central location, documented, and accessible by many team members. Commits and pull requests were used to track modifications to the configuration and foster collaboration, discussion, and review. The only remaining problem with this stage is that the configuration still feels disconnected from the live system. Once a configuration pull request is approved and merged into the repo, the live system is manually updated to match the state of the static repo. This is the exact problem GitOps solves.

The GitOps idea was first hatched and shared by WeaveWorks, an enterprise Kubernetes management firm, and has since proliferated throughout the DevOps community. GitOps is an extension of IaC and declarative configuration discussed above. GitOps adds some magic to the pull request workflow that syncs the state of the live system to that of the static configuration repository.

## The Benefits of GitOps

GitOps shares many of the same benefits as an agile feature branch software development workflow. The first major benefit is ease of adoption due to the usage of common tools. Git is the de facto standard of version control systems and is a common software development tool for most developers and software teams. This makes it easy for developers familiar with Git to become cross-functional contributors and participate in GitOps.

Using a version control system lets a team track all modifications to the configuration of a system. This gives a “source of truth” and a valuable audit trail to review if something breaks or behaves unexpectedly. Teams can review the GitOps history and see when a regression was introduced. Additionally, this audit trail can be used as a reference for compliance or security auditing. The GitOps history can be used as proof when things like encryption certificates are modified or updated.

GitOps brings transparency and clarity to an organization's infrastructure needs around a central repo. Containing all systems configurations in a central repository helps scale contribution input from team members. Pull requests made through hosted Git services like Bitbucket have rich tools for code review and discussion commentary. This builds passive communication loops that allow the full engineering team to observe and monitor infrastructure changes.

GitOps can greatly increase productivity for a DevOps team. It allows them to quickly experiment with new infrastructure configurations. If the new changes don’t behave as expected, a team can use Git history to revert changes to a known good state. This is incredibly powerful since it enables the familiar “undo” functionality in complicated infrastructure.

## How GitOps Works

GitOps procedures are performed by an underlying orchestration system. GitOps itself is an agnostic best practice pattern. Many popular GitOps solutions today primarily use Kubernetes as the orchestration system. Some alternative GitOps tool sets are coming to market that support direct Terraform manipulation.

To achieve a full GitOps install, a pipeline platform is required. Jenkins, Bitbucket Pipelines, or CircleCI are some popular pipeline tools that are complementary to GitOps. Pipelines automate and bridge the gap between Git pull requests and the orchestration system. Once pipeline hooks are established and triggered from pull requests, commands are executed to the orchestration piece.

A new pattern or component specifically introduced with GitOps is the GitOps “operator,” which is a mechanism that sits between the pipeline and the orchestration system. A pull request starts the pipeline that then triggers the operator. The operator examines the state of the repository and the start of the orchestration and syncs them. The operator is the magic component of GitOps.

## GitOps Examples

Imagine a team identified a performance bottleneck or a spike in traffic and the team notices the load balancer is not working as expected. They look into the GitOps repo that holds the infrastructure configuration and find a specific file that configures and deploys the load balancer. They can review it on their online Git hosting site. After some review and discussion, they identify that some of the configuration values for the load balancer are not optimal and need to be adjusted.

A member of the team opens up a new pull request that optimizes the load balancer values. The pull request is reviewed and approved by a second team member and merged into the repository. The merge kicks off a GitOps pipeline, which triggers the GitOps operator. The operator sees the load balancer configuration was changed. It confirms with the systems orchestration tool that this does not match what is live on the team’s cluster.

The operator signals the orchestration system to update the load balancer configuration. The orchestrator handles the rest and automatically deploys the newly configured load balancer. The team then monitors the newly updated live system to see it return to a healthy state. This is an ideal GitOps scenario. Let’s expand on it further to demonstrate GitOps utility.

Let’s imagine that instead of slightly tweaking the load balancer values to be more optimal, the team makes an aggressive decision to deploy an entirely new load balancer type. They feel the current load balancer is fundamentally flawed and want to try an alternative option. The workflow is the same as the value tweak. The team creates a pull request that introduces an entirely new load balancer configuration and deletes the old configuration. It is approved and deployed through the pipeline.

Unfortunately, the team finds that this new type of load balancer is incompatible with some other services within their cluster. The new load balancer causes critical traffic failures and halts user operations. Luckily, because the team has a complete GitOps pipeline, they can quickly undo these load balancer changes. The team will make another pull request that reverts the repository back to the old known functional load balancer. This again will be noted by the GitOps pipeline and automatically deployed. It will rapidly improve the infrastructure and improves the reliability score of the team.

## Summary

GitOps is an incredibly powerful workflow pattern for managing modern cloud infrastructure. Though primarily focused on Kubernetes cluster management, the DevOps community is applying and publishing GitOps solutions to other non-Kubernetes systems. GitOps can bring many benefits to an engineering team including improved communication, visibility, stability, and system reliability. One of the core requirements for a GitOps workflow is adopting a pull request mechanism. GitOps leverages the power of version control systems, such as Git, as the backbone of its practices. The future of GitOps is bright. Its rapid rise in popularity shows organizations are embracing this new methodology to manage complex infrastructure.

# Git vs. Other Version Control Systems: A Comparative Analysis

## Introduction

Version Control Systems (VCS) are powerful tools that employ a method for project management, essential in modern software development. They allow for efficient collaboration among developers. Among all VCS, Git has gained widespread acclaim due to its extensive use in open-source collaboration. However, it is crucial to understand how it compares to other VCS to make informed decisions. This comparative analysis of Git and other version control systems will explore their features, distinctive attributes, advantages, benefits, and future trends.

## Alternative Systems and Their Characteristics

While Git is the most widely used version control system, it is not the easiest to learn for beginners. Therefore, it is essential to analyze and compare before deciding which VCS to use. Below are some alternative version control systems:

### 1. SVN (Subversion)

Imagine SVN as a library where all the books (files) are organized on shelves (the central repository). When an author wants to make changes to a book, they must borrow it, make modifications, and return it to the shelf. This centralization facilitates collaboration, but it also means that authors have to wait their turn to access the books.

### 2. Perforce

Perforce, also known as Helix Core, is like a large, organized warehouse where vast amounts of material (code) are stored. Here, multiple workers can access the warehouse simultaneously, manage their own workspaces, and conduct code reviews. This system is ideal for projects with large codebases, such as those used in game development or financial services.

### 3. Bazaar

Bazaar resembles an open-air market where vendors can set up their own stalls (local repositories) and sell their products (code changes) independently. Vendors can exchange products among themselves, facilitating collaboration without relying on a central location.

## Exploring Git

Git, a decentralized VCS, was created by Linus Torvalds around 2005. Initially, many Linux developers found Git complicated, but today it has solidified its position as a crucial example of distributed version control systems. Unlike centralized systems, the success of Git lies in its decentralized nature, where every working directory is a complete repository with full history and version tracking capabilities. This allows developers to work offline, commit changes, and manage branches without overwriting previous snapshots.

Git’s remarkable speed is one of its standout features. Think of Git as a marathon runner: it moves quickly, even over long distances (large codebases), while centralized version control systems are like runners who have to wait at the starting line (communicate with a central server), which can introduce latency.

## Comparing Other Version Control Systems

While Git is undoubtedly a robust version control system, it is not the only player in the market. It is essential to recognize that there are alternative VCS options. Below are some key comparisons that will help make informed decisions when selecting a suitable version control system for a project’s needs:

### 1. Speed and Performance

Git's model ensures high-speed operations, even with large codebases. In contrast, centralized version control systems tend to be slower for similar tasks due to the need for communication with a central server, which can introduce latency and performance bottlenecks.

### 2. Security and Data Preservation

Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS) rely more on server-based access controls, which can be less resilient against certain types of attacks and may require additional security configurations. On the other hand, Git uses cryptographic hashing for commits, making it highly resilient against unauthorized changes to the commit history.

### 3. Flexibility

The flexibility of Git contrasts with centralized version control systems, which often have rigid workflows and limited decentralization. Git’s distributed approach allows for diverse, adaptable workflows, while CVCS may require more extensive configurations to achieve similar flexibility.

## Application and Adoption in Various Industries

In the financial sector, where precision and accuracy are paramount, Git plays a crucial role in managing codebases for algorithmic trading systems. Multiple teams collaborate on complex trading algorithms, and Git’s branching and merging capabilities ensure that concurrent development efforts remain organized and traceable.

In content creation and publishing, the adoption of Git has enabled collaborative workflows in the media and entertainment industry. Teams working on video, animation, and graphics projects leverage Git for efficient collaboration, version tracking, and the ability to seamlessly merge contributions from different artists and creators, resulting in higher-quality content delivered on time.

However, it is crucial to assess individual industry requirements to determine if Git or alternative version control systems are the best fit for a given scenario.

## Future Trends and Considerations

The future of VCS will respond to changing technologies. Several key trends and considerations will shape the evolution of VCS:

- **Integration with Containerization Technologies:** With the expansion of technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, VCS will need to integrate with these platforms to ensure deployment and scalability.
  
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** VCS will need to adapt to foster real-time collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members.
  
- **Enhanced Security Features:** VCS systems will continue to bolster security features to protect code repositories and sensitive data.
  
- **Innovation in Collaboration Tools:** The rise of remote and distributed teams will drive innovation in collaboration tools, adapting to new ways of working.

## Conclusion

In this comprehensive analysis, we have seen the benefits of Git in the real world, including an in-depth comparative analysis with alternative version control systems. This has shown Git’s widespread application across diverse industries, providing a glimpse into the future of version control systems.
