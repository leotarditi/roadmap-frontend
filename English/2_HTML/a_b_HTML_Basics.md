# Overview of HTML

HTML, or **Hypertext Markup Language**, is like the skeleton of a webpage. Imagine you are building a house: you need a structure to shape and support every room, window, and door. In the case of a webpage, HTML is that structure that defines how information will be organized and displayed.

## What is HTML?

HTML consists of a series of **elements and attributes** used to organize the content of a page in a structured manner. Think of HTML elements as the different rooms in a house: you have a living room, a bathroom, a kitchen. Each one has a clear purpose, and that's how HTML elements work.

In more technical terms, **HTML** describes the structure of documents displayed on the web. These documents are composed of a **tree of nodes**, which includes **HTML elements** and **text nodes**.

## Elements

An **HTML element** is like a box that encloses content and defines how it will appear or function. Each element is composed of **tags**, which act as the lid of that box. In HTML, tags are written between angle brackets `< >`, and come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.

For example:
```html
<h1>Welcome to the Page</h1>
```

The `<h1>` tag is the most important header (like the title of a section). It’s like the main door of a house: everyone sees it first. What’s inside those tags is the content: in this case, the text "Welcome to the Page".

### Nesting Elements

Elements can also be **nested** inside one another, like a small box inside a larger box. It’s important to close tags in the correct order so that the browser (which "reads" these boxes) doesn’t get confused. For example:

```html
<p>This is a <strong>important text</strong> inside a paragraph</p>
```

Here, `<p>` is the paragraph element containing another element `<strong>`, which makes part of the text **bold**. It’s like having a jewelry box inside a chest: both need to be closed in the correct order to keep the content well-organized.

## Attributes

**Attributes** are like additional features of a room. For example, a window might have blinds, anti-reflective glass, or a curtain. Similarly, attributes in HTML add extra information or behaviors to elements.

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A descriptive image">
```

In this example, the `src` attribute tells the browser where to find the image, while the `alt` attribute describes the image, which is useful for search engines or people with visual disabilities.

## Empty and Replaced Elements

Some elements do not need internal content, such as `<img>` or `<input>`. These are called **empty elements** and are like a window in the house: they are just there, without content inside, but serve an important function. Additionally, certain elements are called **replaced elements**, such as an image or a form button, which are "replaced" by something visible or interactive on the page.

## Closing Rules

It’s important to remember that most elements need to be properly closed, like closing a door to keep the house tidy. However, some elements (like `<li>` in lists) can function without being explicitly closed, but it’s a good practice to always close them to avoid display issues.

# HTML Document Structure

In this section, we will break down the basic structure of an HTML document. Although it might sound technical, we will explain it in a simple way with analogies to help you understand it better.

### Imagine Your HTML is Like a House

Think of a webpage as a house. To build it, you need certain basic components that, while sometimes not visible, are essential for everything to work correctly.

1. **<!DOCTYPE html>**: This is like the official blueprints of the house. It tells the browser how to interpret the rest of the "building". Without these blueprints, the browser might misinterpret your page.

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   ```

2. **<html>**: This is the foundation of the house. Everything else is built within this tag. Here is where you define the language of your "building", for example, if it’s in Spanish or English. Just as a house can be in different countries, an HTML document can be in different languages.

   ```html
   <html lang="en">
   ```

### The Roof of the House: <head>

The `<head>` is like the roof of the house; you don't see it from the inside, but it has important functions. This is where you place information about the page that won’t be directly visible on the screen but is crucial for its proper functioning.

1. **<meta charset="utf-8">**: It’s like making sure all the electrical cables and connections are in the right format. UTF-8 is the type of "wiring" that ensures you can use any character or emoji on your page.

   ```html
   <meta charset="utf-8">
   ```

2. **<title>**: This is the name of the house that appears in the browser tab, like the welcome sign at the entrance.

   ```html
   <title>My Website</title>
   ```

3. **<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">**: Imagine you have a house that can change size depending on the visitor (device). This tag ensures your house fits properly whether someone is visiting on a phone or a computer.

   ```html
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
   ```

### The Body of the House: <body>

The `<body>` is everything that visitors see when they enter your house. Here is where the walls, furniture, and interactive elements of your website are located.

   ```html
   <body>
     <!-- Visible content goes here -->
   </body>
   ```

### Summary of the Basic Structure:

So far, our basic "house" HTML looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My Website</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Visible content here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

### Adding Styles (CSS): Painting the House

CSS handles the appearance of the house. You can choose to paint the walls a color, change the style of the furniture, or even add decorations. There are three main ways to add CSS:

1. **Using an external file**: It’s like having a professional decorator who keeps all their tools in one place (an external file).

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   ```

2. **Styles within the document**: If you want to make small changes without hiring someone external, you can add styles within the same HTML file.

   ```html
   <style>
     body {
       background-color: lightblue;
     }
   </style>
   ```

# Metadata in HTML: Understanding the Power of `<meta>` Tags

## Introduction

Imagine you are organizing a large event, like a party. For everything to go smoothly, you need key information about the guests: their preferences, allergies, favorite music, etc. **The `<meta>` tag** in HTML works similarly. It provides important information about your website to browsers and search engines to improve its functioning and appearance.

## What are Metadata?

**Metadata** is data about data. In the context of HTML, it is extra information that is not directly shown on the page but is crucial for browsers, search engines, and social media to interpret and present your content effectively. The `<meta>` tag helps define this metadata.

## Common Meta Tags

### 1. **Charset**: The Language of the Site

Think of **`<meta charset="utf-8">`** as a sign on the party door that says what language will be spoken. If your guests don’t know this, they might arrive and not understand anything. Similarly, **`utf-8`** is the most used character set, ensuring that your page’s text displays correctly in most languages.

### 2. **Viewport**: Adjusting the Screen for Each Device

The **`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`** attribute is like a host who adjusts the space based on the number of guests arriving. This meta allows the page to adapt correctly to the screen size of the user’s device, whether a phone or a computer. Thus, everyone has enough space to move comfortably.

### 3. **Description**: The Party Announcement

The meta tag **description** is like the text you put in an invitation. On the web, it is what search engines show under the title in search results. It is a brief and attractive summary of your content, helping users know if your site is what they are looking for.

```html
<meta name="description" content="Learn about HTML and meta tags in this easy-to-follow article.">
```

### 4. **Robots**: Guests with Restrictions

Just as you might have rules about who can enter your party, with **`<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">`** you can tell search engines **not** to index your page or follow the links. This is useful if you have pages you don’t want to appear in search results.

### 5. **Theme-color**: Customizing the Atmosphere

With **`<meta name="theme-color" content="#ff5733">`**, you set a color for the browser’s address bar or task bar to match the design of your site. It’s like choosing a color scheme to set the mood for your party.

# HTML Attributes

## What Are Attributes?

Think of attributes as "extra instructions" you give to an HTML element to make it do something more specific. It’s like when you write a letter and add instructions on the envelope: "Please deliver before noon." The envelope is the HTML element, and the extra instruction is the attribute.

Attributes in HTML are those additional details we put in the **opening tag** of an element to define its behavior or functionality. These attributes consist of a **name** and a **value** (for example, `type="text"` in an input).

## Basic Example

```html
<input type="text">
```

Here, `input` is the envelope (element) and `type="text"` is the instruction (attribute) we're giving. We're telling the browser that this `input` should be of type text.

## Types of Attributes

### Global Attributes

Some attributes are like general rules that apply to any HTML element, regardless of its type. A good example is the `id` attribute, which gives a unique name to an element on the page. It’s like naming a character in a play: no one else can have the same name, or you'd get confused.

```html
<div id="myUniqueElement"></div>
```

This `div` has a unique `id` called "myUniqueElement". With this `id`, we can clearly identify it in CSS or JavaScript and apply specific styles or behaviors.

### Specific Attributes

There are other attributes that only apply to certain elements. For example, the `src` attribute in an `img` tag specifies the source of the image, like the URL of an image on the internet. It wouldn’t make sense to put `src` in a `div`; it would be like trying to put an address on something that isn't a letter.

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
```

### Boolean Attributes

A boolean attribute is like a light switch: it’s either on or off, with no middle ground. If the attribute is present, it’s like saying "it’s on". If it’s not, then it’s off. An example is the `disabled` attribute on a button.

```html
<button disabled>Disabled Button</button>
```

In this case, the button is "off" or disabled because we’ve added the `disabled` attribute. It’s not necessary to give it a value, as its mere presence indicates that the button is disabled.

### Enumerated Attributes

Enumerated attributes are those with a limited set of possible values. It’s like having a menu with only three choices: pizza, pasta, or salad. An example is the `contenteditable` attribute, which tells the browser whether an element is editable or not. It has only two values: `true` or `false`.

```html
<div contenteditable="true">This text is editable.</div>
```

If you set `contenteditable="true"`, the text inside the `div` can be edited by the user. If you set `contenteditable="false"`, it cannot be edited.

## Correct Use of Attributes

It's important to follow the rules for attributes, especially with case sensitivity. Some attributes, like `id`, are **case-sensitive**. This means `id="myID"` is not the same as `id="MyID"`. On the other hand, some attributes, like `type` in an `input`, are not case-sensitive.

```html
<!-- This is the same -->
<input type="text">
<input type="TeXt">

<!-- This is NOT the same -->
<div id="myID"></div>
<div id="MyID"></div>
```

## Attributes in Action with JavaScript

Attributes can also be manipulated with JavaScript. If you want to change the state of an attribute, such as unmuting a video, you can do it with the following code:

```javascript
const myMedia = document.getElementById("mediaFile");
myMedia.removeAttribute("muted"); // Remove muted attribute
myMedia.setAttribute("muted", ""); // Add the muted attribute
```

## Using the `class` Attribute in HTML

### 🚗 Analogy: "Car Tags"

Imagine each HTML element is like a car in a large garage. Some cars need a special tag to distinguish them from others, maybe by color, model, or fuel type. The **tag** in this case is the `class` attribute, which allows developers to tag certain cars (or HTML elements) so they can later group them and apply enhancements (like paint jobs or new tires, which would be CSS styles).

In HTML, the `class` attribute acts as that tag. It allows you to group elements into categories and apply special styles or behaviors, just like you might label cars in your garage to identify them and make changes more easily.

### 🔍 Technical Explanation

The `class` attribute in HTML is used to group elements and apply styles via **CSS** or behaviors via **JavaScript**. This attribute takes a space-separated list of class names (case-sensitive), meaning that classes are sensitive to uppercase and lowercase.

A basic example of its use would be:

```html
<div class="car sports red"></div>
```

Here, the `<div>` has three classes: `car`, `sports`, and `red`. This allows us to apply styles or behaviors to all elements with the class `car`, all `sports`, or those with the `red` class.

### 🛠️ Selecting Elements with `class`

We can use classes in two main ways:

1. **CSS**: To apply styles to all elements that have a particular class.
   ```css
   .red {
     background-color: red;
   }
   ```

2. **JavaScript**: To manipulate elements that share the same class.
   ```javascript
   const redCars = document.getElementsByClassName('red');
   for (let car of redCars) {
     car.style.border = '2px solid black';
   }
   ```

### 📚 Is It Always Necessary to Use `class`?

It’s not always necessary to add a class to every element. In many cases, the semantic structure of HTML is enough to apply styles and behaviors. For example, we could select elements based on their position or type without needing to use `class`:

- **Without `class`**: Select all paragraphs (`<p>`) or all items within a list (`<li>`).
- **With `class`**: Allows more specificity, such as selecting only the paragraphs that belong to a special class.

```html
<p class="important">This is an important paragraph.</p>
<p>This is a normal paragraph.</p>
```

In this case, we could apply styles only to the paragraph with the `important` class using `.important` in CSS.

# Basic Text Concepts in HTML

## Introduction

Imagine you’re building a house. The **headings** would be like the titles you put on each section of your blueprint: "Living Room", "Kitchen", "Bathroom", etc. Each title has a level of importance, and this also happens in HTML. With these **headings**, we give structure to the content on a webpage.

HTML is the markup language we use to build the structure of a webpage, like the blueprint of a house. It helps browsers understand how to organize the content. In this section, I’ll guide you through the basics of text and how to mark it up in HTML.

---

## Headings in HTML

In HTML, there are six levels of headings, represented by the tags `<h1>` to `<h6>`. They are like the titles and subtitles of a document, where `<h1>` is the most important title (equivalent to "Living Room" in the house blueprint), and `<h6>` is the least important.

```html
<h1>This is a Level 1 Heading</h1>
<h2>This is a Level 2 Heading</h2>
<h3>This is a Level 3 Heading</h3>
```

### Analogy: The Structure of a Book

Think of a book:
- The main title of the book is the **h1**.
- The chapters are **h2**.
- Sections within the chapters are **h3**, and so on.

These headings not only organize content visually but also help users with screen readers navigate a page. Screen readers allow users to jump between headings using the "h" key, making it crucial to have well-structured content.

---

## Paragraphs in HTML

When you have several paragraphs in a book, each is clearly separated by a space. In HTML, this is done with the `<p>` tag, which represents a paragraph.

```html
<p>This is a sample paragraph in HTML.</p>
```

It’s important to close tags correctly to ensure content is displayed as expected. Although in some cases the closing tag may be optional, it's always better to be explicit and close all tags.

### Analogy: A Block of Text

Paragraphs in HTML are like blocks of text in an article. They separate ideas and make the content easier to read.

---

## Quotes and References

To cite text from another source or add emphasis to a phrase, HTML has two key tags: `<blockquote>` and `<q>`.
- The `<blockquote>` tag is for longer quotes, usually displayed in a block separate from the rest of the text.
- The `<q>` tag is for shorter quotes, which are integrated into the flow of the text.

```html
<blockquote cite="https://example.com">
    This is a block quote from an external source.
</blockquote>

<p>As someone famous said: <q>Knowledge is power.</q></p>
```

### Analogy: A Quote Box in an Article

Imagine you’re reading

 an article, and there’s a special box with a famous quote. That’s like the `<blockquote>` tag. If you see a short quote embedded in the text, that’s similar to using the `<q>` tag.

---

## Emphasis and Strong Importance

To emphasize text, you can use the `<em>` tag, which typically renders text in italics. To indicate strong importance, use the `<strong>` tag, which usually renders text in bold.

```html
<p>This is an <em>emphasized</em> word.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>strongly emphasized</strong> word.</p>
```

### Analogy: Highlighting Important Information

- **Emphasize**: Like putting a word in italics or underlining it to show it’s important.
- **Strong Importance**: Like making text bold or using a different color to make it stand out even more.

---

## Lists in HTML

Lists in HTML are like the index or bullet points in a presentation. They come in two main types:

### Unordered Lists (`<ul>`)

Unordered lists use bullets to represent items, like a shopping list where the order doesn’t matter.

```html
<ul>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Bread</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
</ul>
```

### Ordered Lists (`<ol>`)

Ordered lists use numbers to represent items in a sequence, like a recipe where the order of steps is crucial.

```html
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven.</li>
    <li>Mix ingredients.</li>
    <li>Bake the cake.</li>
</ol>
```

### Analogy: Organizing Information

- **Unordered List**: Like listing items you need to buy with bullets.
- **Ordered List**: Like writing down steps in a recipe with numbers to follow.

---

## Code Blocks

When you want to show code or technical text, you use the `<pre>` tag for preformatted text and `<code>` for inline code. The `<pre>` tag preserves spaces and line breaks, while `<code>` is used to highlight small pieces of code within a line.

```html
<pre>
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
</pre>

<p>Use the <code>console.log()</code> function to print messages to the console.</p>
```

### Analogy: Displaying Code

- **Preformatted Text**: Like a block of code shown exactly as it is in a programming book.
- **Inline Code**: Like mentioning a function name in a sentence without disrupting the text flow.

---

## Text Alignment

To align text, HTML provides the `align` attribute, which is used in tags like `<p>`, `<div>`, and `<h1>`. This attribute allows you to align text to the left, center, or right.

```html
<p align="center">This text is centered.</p>
```

### Analogy: Text Alignment

Aligning text is like setting up a document in a word processor where you can choose to align text to the left, center, or right of the page.

# Web Navigation: A Guided Journey

On the web, navigation is like a map that helps users find their way. In this section, we will explore different types of navigation that can enhance the user experience on a website.

## What is Navigation?

Imagine you're in a large bookstore. To find a specific book, you use different tools:

1. **Aisle Signs**: They tell you where the science fiction, cooking, etc., sections are. This is like **global navigation**, which helps you find the main sections of a website.
2. **Breadcrumb Trail**: Shows how to get from the bookstore entrance to the book you want. This is like the **breadcrumb navigation**, which shows the path from the homepage to the current page.
3. **Store Map**: Gives you an overview of all sections and allows you to quickly find the area you're interested in. This is like a **site map**, which provides an overview of the entire website.

### Global Navigation

Global navigation is like the aisle signs in the bookstore. It is a list of links that lead to the main sections of your website, such as "Home", "About Us", "Services", etc. This navigation is usually visible on all pages and can appear in different formats, such as navigation bars, dropdown menus, or floating menus, depending on the user's screen size.

**Code Example**:

```html
<nav aria-label="Global Navigation">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about">About Us</a></li>
    <li><a href="/services">Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

### Breadcrumb Navigation

Breadcrumb navigation is like the bulletin board that shows the path from the entrance to a specific book. On the web, it shows the hierarchy of pages from the homepage to the current page.

**Code Example**:

```html
<nav aria-label="Breadcrumbs">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/category">Category</a></li>
    <li><a href="/category/item">Item</a></li>
    <li aria-current="page">Current Page</li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

### Site Map

A site map is like a bookstore floor plan that shows all sections and shelves. On the web, this is a page that links to all important sections of the site, providing an overview so users can quickly find what they’re looking for.

**Code Example**:

```html
<nav aria-label="Site Map">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about">About Us</a></li>
    <li><a href="/services">Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

### Local Navigation

Local navigation is like the signs in each aisle of the bookstore that help you find the specific book you're looking for in that section. On the web, this refers to links that lead to subsections within a page or specific area of the site.

**Code Example**:

```html
<nav aria-label="Local Navigation">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#section1">Section 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section2">Section 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section3">Section 3</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

### Page Index

A page index is like the index of a book that allows you to see the sections and topics covered in the document. On the web, this can be a list of links to different parts of the current page’s content, which can be shown or hidden based on screen size.

**Code Example**:

```html
<nav aria-label="Table of Contents">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#section1">Introduction</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section2">Main Content</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section3">Conclusion</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

## Accessibility and Usability

To improve accessibility, ensure that users can easily skip to the main content. This can be done using a "Skip to content" link at the top of the page.

**Code Example**:

```html
<a href="#main" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>
<main id="main">
  <!-- Main content here -->
</main>
```

Usability is key. Ensure that navigation is intuitive and that users can find what they are looking for without confusion. Navigation should be consistent and predictable throughout the site.

# Tables in HTML: A Step-by-Step Guide

Tables in HTML are used to display data organized into rows and columns, similar to how seats are arranged in a theater. However, it’s important to use them correctly to ensure that the information is accessible and clear to everyone. In this guide, we will break down how HTML tables work, using simple analogies to better understand each technical concept.

## What is an HTML Table?

Think of a table as a sheet of paper with a grid drawn on it. Each box in the grid can contain specific information. In HTML, we use the `<table>` tag to create this grid of data.

**Analogy:** Think of `<table>` as a "record book" where each page has a grid to record information in an organized manner.

### Table Elements

1. **<table>**: It's like the cover of your record book. It holds all the table elements together.
2. **<caption>**: This is the title of the table, like the header of a page in your record book that tells what it's about. It should be the first element inside `<table>` so that everyone immediately understands the purpose of the table.
3. **<thead>**: Represents the table header. It’s like the column titles in a spreadsheet.
4. **<tbody>**: Contains the main data of the table, similar to the content rows in your spreadsheet.
5. **<tfoot>**: Used for the footer of the table, which can contain summaries or totals, like the totals of a column in your spreadsheet.

**Analogy:** Imagine `<thead>` as the first row of your record book with category names, `<tbody>` as the rest of the rows where you write the data, and `<tfoot>` as a section at the end for summaries.

### Rows and Cells

- **<tr>**: A row in the table, like a line in a spreadsheet.
- **<th>**: A header cell, which is bold and centered by default. It's like the title of a column in your spreadsheet.
- **<td>**: A data cell that contains the actual information, like the values in a spreadsheet.

**Analogy:** Think of `<tr>` as a row of data in your spreadsheet. `<th>` is like the header of that row, and `<td>` is where you put the data.

### Combining Cells

You can combine cells to span more space using:

- **colspan**: Combines cells in a row. It’s like merging two columns in your spreadsheet to make a wider cell.
- **rowspan**: Combines cells in multiple rows. It’s like merging two rows in your spreadsheet to make a taller cell.

**Analogy:** Imagine you need a cell that spans multiple columns or rows in your spreadsheet. You use `colspan` or `rowspan` to combine those cells, just like in an HTML table.

### Grouping Columns

- **<colgroup>** and **<col>**: Allow you to group columns and apply styles to them. It's like using a highlighter in your spreadsheet to change the color of several columns at once.

**Analogy:** If you need to apply a color to multiple columns in your spreadsheet, you use a function to select all of them. In HTML, you use `<colgroup>` and `<col>` to do the same.

### Styling Tables

Tables are not responsive by default. To make them adaptable to different screen sizes, you need to use CSS:

- **border-collapse** and **border-spacing**: Control the space between cells and table borders.

**Analogy:** If you want to adjust the space between cells in your spreadsheet, you use formatting tools. In HTML, you use CSS to achieve the same.

### Accessibility

It's crucial that tables are accessible to everyone, including users with disabilities. Use ARIA attributes and ensure headers and cells are well-defined.

**Analogy:** If you need your record book to be accessible to everyone, make sure to clearly label sections and use colors that are visible to all. In HTML, you do this with ARIA attributes and a clear structure.

### Do Not Use Tables for Layout

Don’t use tables to organize non-tabular content, like images or page layout. For that, use lists or CSS Grid.

**Analogy:** Don’t use a spreadsheet to design a slide presentation. Use a presentation tool for that. In HTML, use lists and CSS for layout instead of tables.

## Complete Example

Here’s an example of a well-structured HTML table:

```html
<table>
  <caption>MLW Students</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Year</th>
      <th>Student</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">1956</th>
      <td>Lou Minious</td>
    </tr>
   

 <tr>
      <th scope="row">1961</th>
      <td>Lou Minious</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">1962</th>
      <td>Lou Minious</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">1971</th>
      <td>Jorge N. López</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">1981</th>
      <td>José F. Martínez</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">1982</th>
      <td>José F. Martínez</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

In this example, the table shows students and years, with a header row, data rows, and a caption. 

# Audio and Video in HTML: A Guide with Analogies

## Introduction

As you learned in the images module, HTML allows you to embed multimedia content on a webpage. In this section, we'll explore audio and video files, including the basics of integrating them into your web pages, how to use user controls, and how to ensure your multimedia content is accessible to everyone.

## Embedding Audio and Video

### How Does It Work?

Imagine you're building a house. The `<audio>` and `<video>` tags in HTML are like the doors and windows of your house, allowing visitors to see and hear the interior. These tags let you embed multimedia players directly on your webpage.

#### Example of `<video>`

```html
<video src="videos/machines.webm" poster="images/machine.jpg" controls>
  <p>Watch <a href="https://youtube.com/link">video on Youtube</a></p>
</video>
```

In this example, the `<video>` tag is like a window in your house showing a video. The `src` attribute is the address of the video (like the glass in the window), `poster` is the image shown before the video starts (like a curtain covering the window), and `controls` adds buttons to pause, play, and adjust the volume (like a blinds you can adjust).

### Alternative Content

Always include alternative content within `<video>` or `<audio>` tags. This is like leaving a note on the window for people who can't view the video, telling them what to do if the window is broken.

#### Example with Alternative Content

```html
<video controls poster="images/machine.jpg">
  <source src="videos/machines.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="videos/machines.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="videos/machines.ogv" type="video/ogg">
  <p>Watch <a href="https://youtube.com/link">video on Youtube</a></p>
</video>
```

Here, we use multiple video sources (like having different types of windows in the same house) to ensure the video displays in all browsers.

### Attributes and Codecs

The `type` attribute in the `<source>` tag tells the browser what type of video it's viewing. This is like labeling the types of glass in your windows, so each type of window is placed correctly.

```html
<source src="videos/machines.webm" type="video/webm;codecs=vp8,vorbis">
<source src="videos/machines.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=avc1.4d002a">
```

### Video Appearance

The `poster` attribute is the image shown before the video starts, like a cover on an album. Make sure the aspect ratio of the video and the poster match to avoid the video displaying incorrectly when played.

### Accessibility

For those who can't hear, you can add subtitles and descriptions. This is like offering a Braille instruction book for visitors who can't see well.

#### Example of Subtitles and Descriptions

```html
<video controls poster="images/machine.jpg">
  <source src="videos/machines.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="videos/machines.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="videos/machines.ogv" type="video/ogg">
  <track label="English" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" src="vtt/subtitles-en.vtt" default />
  <track label="Francais" kind="subtitles" srclang="fr" src="vtt/subtitles-fr.vtt" />
  <p>Watch <a href="https://youtube.com/link">video on Youtube</a></p>
</video>
```

Track files should be in WebVTT (.vtt) format, and you can add subtitles, transcripts, and descriptions to make your content accessible to everyone.

### Background Videos

Sometimes, designers want a background video with no visible controls. This is like putting up a presentation screen in the office with no buttons to change the channel. Ensure these videos don’t interfere with accessibility and consider offering controls if needed.

#### Example of Background Video

```html
<video autoplay loop muted poster="images/machine.jpg" role="none">
  <source src="videos/machines.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="videos/machines.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="videos/machines.ogv" type="video/ogg">
</video>
```

### Custom Multimedia Controls

If you want to create custom controls, it's like designing your own tools to open and close windows. You can use JavaScript to add buttons that play or pause the audio.

#### Example of Custom Button

```html
<button id="playPause" aria-controls="idOfAudio"
  data-pause-text="Pause audio"
  data-play-text="Play audio">Pause audio</button>
```

```javascript
const pauseButton = document.getElementById('playPause');

pauseButton.addEventListener("click", pauseAndPlay, false);

function pauseAndPlay() {
  const media = document.getElementById(this.getAttribute('aria-controls'));

  if (media.paused) {
    media.play();
    this.innerText = this.dataset.pauseText;
  } else {
    media.pause();
    this.innerText = this.dataset.playText;
  }
}
```

# Templates, Slots, and Shadow DOM in Web Components

## Introduction

Web components allow you to create reusable elements that can be easily integrated into existing applications. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we can create components that encapsulate both structure and style and that operate independently of the rest of the page. We’ll explore three key concepts in this process: **templates**, **slots**, and **Shadow DOM**.

## Web Components: An Analogy

Imagine you're building a set of **LEGO blocks**. Each block has a specific shape and color, and you can combine them in different ways to create unique structures. Web components work similarly: you can build a component (like a rating widget) and then reuse it in different parts of your application, combining it with other "blocks" to build a complete interface.

## Template

The **`<template>`** element in HTML is like a toolbox in your LEGO set. Inside the box (or template), you have all the blocks you need to build a part of your structure, but the box itself isn’t visible in your final construction. Only when you decide to use the blocks and build something new, do they become visible.

```html
<template id="star-rating-template">
  <form>
    <fieldset>
      <legend>Rate your experience:</legend>
      <rating>
        <input type="radio" name="rating" value="1" aria-label="1 star" required />
        <input type="radio" name="rating" value="2" aria-label="2 stars" />
        <input type="radio" name="rating" value="3" aria-label="3 stars" />
        <input type="radio" name="rating" value="4" aria-label="4 stars" />
        <input type="radio" name="rating" value="5" aria-label="5 stars" />
      </rating>
    </fieldset>
    <button type="reset">Reset</button>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</template>
```

In this example, the template defines a rating form with stars, but this form won’t render until JavaScript uses the template content and adds it to the DOM.

## Slot

The **`<slot>`** element acts like a storage box where you can place different types of pieces (or content). Think of slots as specific spaces in LEGO blocks where you can insert other pieces to customize your build.

```html
<template id="star-rating-template">
  <form>
    <fieldset>
      <slot name="star-rating-legend">
        <legend>Rate your experience:</legend>
      </slot>
      <rating>
        <input type="radio" name="rating" value="1" aria-label="1 star" required />
        <input type="radio" name="rating" value="2" aria-label="2 stars" />
        <input type="radio" name="rating" value="3" aria-label="3 stars" />
        <input type="radio" name="rating" value="4" aria-label="4 stars" />
        <input type="radio" name="rating" value="5" aria-label="5 stars" />
      </rating>
    </fieldset>
    <button type="reset">Reset</button>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</template>
```

Here, the `<slot>` allows you to insert a custom element (like a different legend) in the defined place within the component.

## Shadow DOM

The **Shadow DOM** is like a sealed LEGO box, ensuring that the pieces inside it cannot be altered from the outside. This means the styles and behavior of components inside this box are independent of the rest of the page.

```javascript
customElements.define('star-rating', class extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    const starRating = document.getElementById('star-rating-template').content;
    const shadowRoot = this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
    shadowRoot.appendChild(starRating.cloneNode(true));
  }
});
```

In this code, a new `<star-rating>` element is defined that uses the content from the template inside a Shadow DOM. This ensures that the styles and content of the component are not affected by external CSS.

### Encapsulated Styles



Styles defined in the Shadow DOM are scoped to that component only, so they won’t affect other parts of the page or be affected by the page's styles.

```css
<style>
  rating {
    display: inline-block;
    font-size: 1.5em;
  }
  input[type="radio"] {
    display: none;
  }
</style>
```

This ensures that the styles of your component are isolated, similar to having a unique color scheme for your LEGO blocks that won’t interfere with other blocks.

# Focus and Tab Navigation in Frontend: A Journey Through Tab Navigation

## Introduction

Imagine navigating a webpage like it's a maze. Interactive elements (like buttons, links, and forms) are doors you can pass through, while other elements are closed or blocked. This maze has a specific order in which you can move, and your task is to ensure that everyone can navigate it easily.

## Tab Navigation: How Does It Work?

### Default Focus

By default, interactive elements on a webpage are like doors that you can open with the Tab key. These doors are in the same order as they are arranged in the maze (the source code), and the tab key allows you to move from one to another sequentially.

**Analogy:** Imagine the tab key is a magic key that lets you open doors in the order they are placed. If you change the order of the doors but use the same key, you might get lost in the maze.

### HTML Attributes for Controlling Focus

1. **`tabindex`**: This attribute is like a guide telling you the order in which to open the doors. A value of `0` allows you to open the door in the normal order, while a positive value (`1`, `2`, etc.) puts you in a special queue of priority doors. A negative value (`-1`) makes the door inaccessible with the tab key, but you can still open it with a shortcut key (if you know the combination).

2. **`contenteditable`**: It's like a label telling the door it can be edited. If you set `contenteditable="true"`, you can now write on that door. This makes the door accessible with the Tab key, but only if it also has `tabindex="0"`.

3. **`autofocus`**: Imagine that when you enter the maze, the first door you see is automatically the one that opens. `autofocus` makes this happen with the first focusable element on the page when it loads. However, it can be a bit finicky and sometimes cause confusion if not used carefully.

### Avoiding Chaos in Navigation

If you confuse the order of doors with CSS, you might end up with a disordered maze. For example, if you use CSS to change the position of a door without adjusting the tab order, users might get lost, trying to find their way in a maze that doesn't follow the visual order.

**Visual Examples of Problems:**

- **With Chaotic `tabindex`:** If you place a high value on `tabindex`, users will follow an unexpected order that might confuse them.
  
- **With Chaotic CSS:** If you use CSS properties like `flex-flow: row-reverse;` to change the visual order but don't adjust `tabindex`, the keyboard navigation order gets out of sync with the visual order, creating a frustrating experience.

### Making Inactive Doors Inert

If you want some doors to be unreachable with the Tab key, use `tabindex="-1"`. These doors are still there but can't be opened with the magic key. To make a door completely inaccessible, you can use `disabled` or `inert`.

1. **`disabled`**: It's like putting a "closed" sign on the door. Users can't open it even with clicks.

2. **`inert`**: It's like locking the door and the entire room. Not only is the door closed, but everything inside is also inaccessible.

**Note:** While `inert` is powerful, it doesn't give visual cues that the door is closed, which might be confusing. Always ensure it's obvious to users that a door is inactive.

## Final Tips

- **Keep Order:** Ensure the tab order follows the visual order whenever possible.
- **Make It Clear:** Use CSS styles like `:focus` so users can see which door is currently open.
- **Test:** Navigate through your page with the keyboard and ensure everything is in order.

By following these principles, you can create a navigation maze that is intuitive and accessible for all users.

# Inline Text Elements in HTML

HTML is like the language we use to communicate with browsers. Although it was created to share documents, it has many tools to present information clearly and organized. In this article, we'll explore some inline text elements that help make our documents more meaningful and understandable.

## **Basic Inline Text Elements**

Imagine HTML as a notebook. Some elements are like specific tools to make important notes and differentiate them from the rest of the text.

### **1. `<code>` and `<pre>`**

When we want to display a piece of code in our notebook, we use the `<code>` element. It's like using a monospaced font to make the code clear and orderly. If we have multiple lines of code, we enclose them in `<pre>`, which is like a special container that preserves the code's format.

```html
<pre>
<code>
function sayHello() {
  console.log('Hello, World!');
}
</code>
</pre>
```

### **2. `<data>` and `<time>`**

Think of `<data>` as a label with automatic translation. If you have a date or number, you can use `<time>` to format it in a way computers can easily understand, like a calendar or search engine.

```html
<time datetime="2024-09-25">September 25, 2024</time>
```

### **3. `<samp>`, `<kbd>`, and `<var>`**

- **`<samp>`** is like showing a result from a machine or program. Imagine a printer showing a message; `<samp>` represents it.

- **`<kbd>`** is used to show keyboard inputs. It's like writing in your notebook what keys you should press.

- **`<var>`** is used for variables in mathematics or programming, like writing a symbol that you might change later.

```html
<kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd>
<var>x</var>
```

## **Elements for Showing Changes and Annotations**

Just like in a notebook, sometimes we need to mark changes or make annotations.

### **4. `<del>` and `<ins>`**

- **`<del>`** is like using a line to strike through text that is no longer valid. You can add a note about why it was removed and when.

- **`<ins>`** is the opposite. It's like writing a new note in the margin, adding text that wasn't there before.

```html
<p>The previous text was <del>deleted</del> and replaced by <ins>new text</ins>.</p>
```

### **5. `<sup>` and `<sub>`**

- **`<sup>`** is for superscripts, like the small numbers above in mathematical formulas.

- **`<sub>`** is for subscripts, like the small numbers below in formulas.

```html
<p>The formula for water is H<sub>2</sub>O and the power of two is 2<sup>2</sup>.</p>
```

### **6. `<s>`**

The **`<s>`** element is used to mark text that is no longer relevant. It's like putting a line through an old note that we no longer need.

```html
<p>This text is <s>obsolete</s> and no longer used.</p>
```

## **Special Text Elements**

Sometimes we need to annotate or emphasize certain parts of the text to make them stand out.

### **7. `<em>`, `<mark>`, `<strong>`, and `<cite>`**

- **`<em>`** is like using a highlighter to emphasize something. The more nested it is, the more emphasis it has.

- **`<mark>`** is for highlighting relevant information, like marking important terms in a document.

- **`<strong>`** is for highlighting something very important. Browsers usually render it in bold.

- **`<cite>`** is for citing titles of books, articles, or works.

```html
<p>This is an <em>emphasized text</em> and this is a <mark>highlighted text</mark>. Additionally, the book <cite>HTML for Everyone</cite> is very useful.</p>
```

## **Elements for Defining Terms and Languages**

When learning or explaining something new, sometimes we need to define terms or mention different languages.

### **8. `<abbr>`, `<dfn>`, `<bdi>`, `<bdo>`, `<ruby>`, `<rt>`, and `<rp>`**

- **`<abbr>`** is used to define abbreviations and acronyms.

- **`<dfn>`** is used to define a new term.

- **`<bdi>`** and **`<bdo>`** help manage text in languages read from right to left.

- **`<ruby>`**, **`<rt>`**, and **`<rp>`** are used to show annotations for characters in languages like Japanese.

```html
<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
<dfn>Frontend</dfn> is the design and development of the visible part of a web application.
```

## **Whitespace Elements**

Finally, to manage whitespace in your document, you can use:

### **9. `<br>`, `<hr>`, and `<wbr>`**

- **`<br>`** is like adding a new line, ideal for addresses or poetry.

- **`<hr>`** is like drawing a horizontal line to separate sections.

- **`<wbr>`** suggests where a long word can be broken if necessary.

```html
<address>
1234 Elm Street<br>
Springfield, IL 62704
</address>

<p>This is a long text with <wbr

>possible line break.</p>
<hr>
<p>Section Separator</p>
```
